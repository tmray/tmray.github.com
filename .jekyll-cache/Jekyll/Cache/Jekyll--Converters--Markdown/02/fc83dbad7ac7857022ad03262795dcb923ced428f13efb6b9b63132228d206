I"o<p>Got wrapped up in a conversation about action figure collections with another that has one.</p>

<p>This lead to looking on web for them.</p>

<p>Started with <a href="https://amzn.to/1JnArMU" target="_blank">He-Man</a>,
then <a href="https://amzn.to/1OcCxD5" target="_blank">M.A.S.K.</a>,
then <a href="https://amzn.to/1THzy9c" target="_blank">Silverhawks</a>,
then <a href="https://amzn.to/1Lftd3A" target="_blank">Battle of the Planets</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTAwWDMyOQ==/z/QrEAAOxyeZNTViKv/$_35.JPG" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" />While looking at rows of pictures from these searches, an old Whitman published 4 color comic was in the mix. I instantly had to open and look at that.</p>

<p>I don’t know what it is but I am just obsessed with those publications. It’s just something about them. Flat colors, the weight and style of the inking and the overall print paper type. Just something about it.</p>

<p>I have to stop myself from looking at those because all I want to do is buy any of them that I find instantly.</p>

<p>I have a whole box of them that I’ve bought over the years that I’ve not even read. And I was nearly on the verge of buying another, just from looking at the cover. What is it about them?</p>

<p>If I could figure out what it is that causes that reaction in the brain I would never have to work again.</p>
