I"™<p>How long should one wait on campaign performance?</p>

<p>Take Facebook ads for example. Iâ€™ve heard wait at least 24 hours before deciding if itâ€™s optimized. Iâ€™ve also heard up to 48 hours.</p>

<p>If the ads are costing too much per click, when should you pull the plug or revamp?</p>

<p>With the ability to watch this happen in real time itâ€™s very easy to decide to change it. Is that just watching a boiling pot?</p>

<p>At some point itâ€™s like the new form of online gambling. You put your own products in the pool. But those you show your cards to only need to invest their time to play in the beginning. Unless they antes up because they like what you show them.</p>

<p>If you believe in what youâ€™re sharing, it really makes it feel personal. But remember, those you asked to play werenâ€™t asking.</p>

<p>Make sure what you have to offer is something that helps. I think itâ€™s the only way.</p>
