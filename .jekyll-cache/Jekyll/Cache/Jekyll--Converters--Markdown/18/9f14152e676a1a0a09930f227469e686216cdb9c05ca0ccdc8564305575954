<p>Growing up there was a commercial, take the nestea plunge. Was just a person standing at the edge of a pool, takes a drink and falls backwards into the water.</p>

<p>We had a pool and friends and I pretty much stood on the edge yelling ‚ÄúNestea plunge!‚Äù and falling in pretty much all summer.</p>

<p>Thought about that today. First time in a while.</p>

<p>Not because of summer or swimming. I‚Äôve been thinking about doing something I wanted to try for a while. A new path.</p>

<p>Always seem to talk myself out of it or procrastinate. Then I go back to thinking about it. Study more about how to do it but never pull the trigger.</p>

<p>Today I set myself up for situation where its on me to follow through. Whether I like it or not. Put myself out there. Made a commitment and said I could do it.</p>

<p>Didn‚Äôt do it for money. I did it so I could stop thinking to myself‚Äì I should do that someday.</p>

<p>Guess what? Its someday. And I convinced someone to take a chance on what I think I can do.</p>

<p>Took the plunge. Nestea plunge. That‚Äôs what made me think of it.</p>
