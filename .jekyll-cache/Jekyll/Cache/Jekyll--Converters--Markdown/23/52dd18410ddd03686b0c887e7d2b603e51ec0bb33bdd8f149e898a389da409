I"0<p>Crammed so many things into a drip of weekend. Monday seems past already.</p>

<p>A feeling of time passed. Has it not been days? It can be.</p>

<p>Want was further gone. Uninterested in the drum of humming along to what I thought was gone already.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s not better to do the same time.</p>
