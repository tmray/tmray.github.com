I"‡<p>Been trying to find a way for a while now to combine things I like to do â€“ drawing, music, podcasting, promotion &amp; web.</p>

<p>Thing is I kept thinking of them separately. Which, I still do.</p>

<p>But I had an idea as I was putting together a video tutorial for a promotional project. I was editing the video to make it not seem so involved.</p>

<p>So I started storyboarding what I had done so far on paper. Then as I looked at the drawings I thought why canâ€™t I just clean those up and use them?</p>

<p>I tell you why. It would take too long.</p>

<p>So here is my goal. I am going to try and keep most of my artwork mobile. Think of a way to do what I need only using my phone. I think that way I wonâ€™t be tempted to make it more involved. Plus, Iâ€™ll be able to work on it anywhere.</p>

<p>I can then use those drawings as slides in a PowerPoint. Record the audio separately, and play it along with the slides, recording it to video. Like a storyboard animatic.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s just a way I think I can work on building my other skills while sticking with my current project. And maybe, mixing all the things I want to do together.</p>
