I"<p>I know it happens to everyone. It must.</p>

<p>Have a great idea, but it’s late. You’re tired.</p>

<p>But this idea will change the world. Change my life!</p>

<p>But it’s late. I’m tired. Need to go to sleep.</p>

<p>I’m sure I’ll remember tomorrow. How could an earth shattering revelation like this not be there when I wake up tomorrow?</p>

<p>Should write it down. Record it on my phone.</p>

<p>No. Too tired. It’ll be there tomorrow when I wake up. I’m sure of it.</p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>Or, scenario number 2.</p>

<p>Before I fall asleep I should write that down.</p>

<p>I do.</p>

<p>Next morning. Reading it back.</p>

<p>What the hell was I thinking? That’s just silly.</p>

<hr />

<p>Oh wait! I just remembered what it was.</p>

<p>Never mind.</p>
