I"r<p>One of the reasons I started the podcast I do, <a href="http://musicmanumit.com" target="_blank">Music Manumit</a>, is to learn more about creative commons music and meet other like minded people that do the same thing. And I have. I’ve meet so many that I don’t remember all of them off the top of my head. And that’s a problem.<br />

Friday I talked with the new head of the site <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/" target="_blank">free music archive</a>, <strong>Cheyenne Hohman</strong>, who is a great person and has done a lot for the site in the time that she’s been there. Though promotion, reaching out to people and reinvigorating the <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/tag/radio_free_culture/" target="_blank">radio free culture podcast</a>. Talking to her inspired me. Which is the whole point of doing interviews with people like her.</p>

<p>I’ve talked to the last 3 people in her position at the site over the years and not kept in touch. why? I didn’t even know until we scheduled the interview with Cheyenne that Andrea, the previous person had left.</p>

<p>I have connections with so many of these people that I need to get better at keeping in touch. Talking to them about like minded projects and collaborating with them. Bring them in on ideas i have, because they, as I mentioned, are doing what I am too– getting their stuff out there and wanting people to create from it &amp; with it. We should all keep connected. Why wouldn’t we?</p>

<p>First try at doing this was a cover of a song my band <a href="http://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2015/06/stampede-biting-elbows-cover.html" target="_blank" title="Lorenzo/'s Music: Stampede - Biting Elbows Cover">Lorenzo’s Music</a> made of the <a href="https://www.jamendo.com/en/track/784184/the-stampede" target="_blank" title="Biting Elbows: The Stampede"><strong>Biting Elbows</strong> song “Stampede”</a>.</p>

I had the singer <a href="http://www.musicmanumit.com/2015/01/biting-elbows-150118-music-manumit.html" target="_blank"><strong>Ilya Naishuller</strong> on the podcast before</a> and I thought it would be a good start. After doing recording and live video of the song, I shared a link with him and he shared it to his people too. Being a creative commons song (cc-by-nc-sa) we were able to do this, no worries.</p>

<p>Even this little bit of our connection made it a very successful experiment. After that others that saw contacted me to use the song we did in their own way with their projects. Like we did.</p>

<p>I need to keep in touch more with people I meet or what’s the point of doing?</p>
