<p>I was talking with musician <a href="https://www.musicmanumit.com/2016/08/curtis-chris-roman-160807-music-manumit.html">Curtis Chris Roman on the podcast this week</a>. During the interview he told me about a thing he does on the side, making block prints.</p>

<p>What you do is, carve a design on a linoleum block, then roll ink on it, and make a print by pressing that on to something.</p>

<p>I saw some of his work he did on t-shirts and was kind of inspired by it.</p>

<p>The next day I went and got the materials to do one myself.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve done screen printing in the past but it always seems such a pain in the ass. The emulsion, burning the image in the screen, squeegee the ink across the screen.</p>

<p>If you want to make another design you can set up another screen, or replace the design you have. All of that stuff always kept me from making new ones.</p>

<p>Print blocks, from what he told me, seemed like a way I could just make design blocks and reuse them whenever I wanted to. I liked that idea.</p>

<p>There still is the process of making the print, you have to carve it into the linoleum block by hand.</p>

<p>But now I can just keep it in a drawer or something and use it whenever I want, or make a couple more to choose from.</p>
