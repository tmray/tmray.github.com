I"<p>Worked on some of my other projects this weekend and had updates I wanted to share.</p>

<p>##Lorenzo’s Music - “We all fall down” video</p>

<p>Posted a live in studio performance video. One of the songs from an internet show put on my band <a href="http://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2015/07/we-all-fall-down-live-video.html">Lorenzo’s Music</a>.</p>

<p>This is the first song from that event - <strong>“We all fall down”</strong>.</p>

<p>We took a Google hangout live stream and went one better. Got ourselves set up with 3 cameras, had someone we know direct it and ran the sound though the studio mixer.</p>

<p>##Music Manumit Podcast</p>

<p>This is for the creative commons music podcast show that I’ve been doing for quite a few years now.</p>

<p>There was someone that we were supposed to talk to this weekend but never showed. Instead of calling it a wash and skipping a week, I had a subject to cover I thought somewhat relevant.</p>

<p>The night before, another creative commons musician we know tweeted, his music was uploaded illegally to digital outlets. The person uploading it claimed they had rights to own and sell his music. So he filed copyright infringement suit against them.</p>

<p>Took this chance to have a discussion with my co-host Doug, about creative commons artists and the fact that they still have rights.</p>

<p>Common mistake people make is, you can do anything you want with music under a CC license. That’s not true.  The license itself says “Some rights reserved”. These rights apply <strong>with</strong> basic copyright, not remove it.</p>

<p>Have a listen to the episode on the <a href="http://www.musicmanumit.com/2015/07/copyright-fight-150726-music-manumit.html">Music Manumit Podcast website</a>.</p>
