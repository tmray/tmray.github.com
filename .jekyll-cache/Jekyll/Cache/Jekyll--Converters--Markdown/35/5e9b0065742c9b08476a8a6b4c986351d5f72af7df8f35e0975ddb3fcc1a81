I"Í<p>In the past month Iâ€™ve been moving forward on a project Iâ€™ve had in my head a while now. And the more I got into it, more things would come up.</p>

<p>To give you some context, itâ€™s basically a crash course on creating something. I figured I needed some landing pages with a cart. Then I would record some instructional videos for it.</p>

<p>I mapped it all out. I could get the website set up pretty simple, make a logo, record video on my phone, and have it up and ready in no time.</p>

<p>I began by writing out the dialog for the videos. While doing that, I got an idea for how to do something else. So I would stop writing and spend the next few hours figuring that out.</p>

<p>Next thing you know, I spent all my time working on something else and not finishing what I was going to write.</p>

<p>Plus, the thing that got me sidetracked in the first place, turned out to be a great idea! So now, I want to add that to the entire mix, making more work for myself.</p>

<p>This has been happening all through the project, in every aspect. From making the logo, designing the webpages, you name it.</p>

<p>I know lots of people suggest outsourcing it to things like <strong>fiverr</strong> or something, and I looked into that.</p>

<p>Guess what, that turned into spending a good part of a day on that. And as I looked for people to do what I needed, I realized I was kind of just shifting from doing it myself, to explaining it to others.</p>

<p>I figured it wasnâ€™t the ability I needed to fix. It was being accountable. I needed someone to keep me on task. You know who does that really well? My wife.</p>

<p>At her current job, my wife runs a building, manages a large staff of people, controls budgets and pricing things out. All stuff I need to do, aside from just finishing the project. So I asked her to manage me.</p>

<p>The benefit of this is a canâ€™t really bullshit her. She has no problem telling me to explain things that Iâ€™m doing. And the concept of my project is to help people that are at a beginner level. With her involvement she can tell me when something doesnâ€™t make sense, and why. Itâ€™s like instant user testing.</p>

<p>My thought is, why not work on things you love with the people you love.</p>
