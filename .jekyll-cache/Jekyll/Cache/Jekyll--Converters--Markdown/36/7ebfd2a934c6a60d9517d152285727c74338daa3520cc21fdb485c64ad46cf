I"€<p>Iâ€™m fascinated by deja vu. (see what I did there?)</p>

<p>It happens to me a lot. And while reading about it this afternoon there are of course many different theories as to why it happens.</p>

<p>One theory says itâ€™s connected to epilepsy. But I donâ€™t know anybody thatâ€™s said theyâ€™ve never experienced it in one way or another. So that canâ€™t be right can it?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œThe strongest pathological association of deja vu is with temporal lobe epilepsy. This correlation has led some researchers to speculate that the experience of deja vu is possibly a neurological anomaly related to improper electrical discharge in the brain.â€</p>

<p>I think the concept of studying something that you canâ€™t clearly show other people is amazing. You can only describe what it is like to you. You donâ€™t REALLY know what it is until youâ€™ve experienced it. Like explaining being in love.</p>

<p>When it happens to me I find myself just trying to figure out what it was that it reminds me of. Like seeing an actor in a movie that you recognize, but just canâ€™t place.</p>

<p>And when you experience it, are you like me and think itâ€™s some big premonition? Something on another level is trying to tell you something? Why is that? Why does it always have to mean something?</p>

<p>I think itâ€™s just the spookiness of the â€œsecond siteâ€ thatâ€™s had. Tells you it must mean something. Why would such a unique experience be wasted on something that means nothing?</p>
