I"ò<p>For days now Iâ€™ve been doing transcriptions. Pouring over huge audio recordings of band practices.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m doing this because, I got this idea to document and piece them together as audio scenes in a series format.</p>

<p>At first I thought I could wing it. On the fly. Put it together in my head and arrange the pieces.</p>

<p>The more I listened, the more I forgotâ€¦Where things were said, on what take, at what time in the recording. It became overwhelming.</p>

<p>So I realized I was just making it harder by not doing it. Writing time signature and quotes. Key elements &amp; sound reference.</p>

<p>Surprisingly it only took a day or so, in my free time. Still much but not unreasonable.</p>

<p>What I found from doing this is, with a greater understanding of what I had recorded, I found a different perspective. A different angle to tell the story I set out to do.</p>

<p>I think knowing what had happened after the fact, shined a light on what I missed. Even though I was there.</p>
