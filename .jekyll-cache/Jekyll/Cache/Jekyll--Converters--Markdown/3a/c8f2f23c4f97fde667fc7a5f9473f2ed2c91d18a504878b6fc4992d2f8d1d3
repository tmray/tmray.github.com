I"ù<p>Outside of the fact that every year Christmas decorations appear in stores earlier than the year before. Why does Halloween end so abruptly? Turned off like a light switch.</p>

<p>It is the morning after Halloween and my email inbox is already filled with holiday promotions. As I am writing this, I just got an invite to my friends annual Christmas party.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm just curious why it doesn‚Äôt get the same time consideration as Christmas? I‚Äôm just supposed to move right on to the next.</p>

<p>But when Christmas is over, its perfectly OK to keep your decorations up well into February.</p>

<p>I think I‚Äôm just upset that I know winter is coming.</p>
