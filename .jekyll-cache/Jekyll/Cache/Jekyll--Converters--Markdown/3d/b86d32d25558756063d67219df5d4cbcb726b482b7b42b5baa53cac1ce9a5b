<p>There used to be these trading cards for the video game <strong>Pac-man</strong>.</p>

<p>Most trading cards just had pictures and a stick of gum. The crappy kind that they would put in them that only seemed to be available in card packs.</p>

<p>A lot of the card packs, if you collected enough, the backs of them would create a picture of some kind. Like a puzzle that you would put together to make one giant picture.</p>

<p>During the heyday of video games in arcades, <strong>Nintendo trading cards</strong> came out. The most popular one to me being <strong>Pac-man</strong>.</p>

<p>They weren‚Äôt the same as the others. They even had a sort of lottery card like element added to them. Basically, one card would look like a grid from the pacman game, and you would scratch off some of the larger ‚Äúpellets‚Äù on it to see what was behind it.</p>

<p>On top of that, all the artwork was just really cool. Me and all my friends thought that the new 8-bit graphics that these arcade games had were just genius. We tried to emulate those particular styles in our own drawings and artwork.</p>

<p>The reason I bring all this up is because I was thinking today about these cards. It occurred to me that it was the first, and only time, that I can remember I ever stole something.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve by no means been an angel my entire life. But I recalled the one time I stole a pack of these cards and how I really felt bad about it.</p>

<p>There was a convenience store that me and my friends would hang out in front of. Kind of the same way <strong>Jay &amp; Silent Bob</strong> hang out in front of the convenience store in the movie <strong>Clerks</strong>.</p>

<p>We would spend the entire day there, to the point where we had made friends with the teenage girl that worked behind the counter.</p>

<p>One day, I wanted to get another pack of cards. Now, I don‚Äôt remember if I didn‚Äôt have the money or if I was just dared to do this, but I went into the convenience store and put a pack of those cards into my shirt.</p>

<p>Not only was this a dumb thing to do‚Äì I was really bad at it. Why would I stuff them in my shirt instead of putting them in my pocket? They‚Äôre cards?!</p>

<p>So as I‚Äôm walking out of the store, trying to act all nonchalant, the girl behind the counter was looking at me and I started to get nervous and felt guilty. I think she could tell by the look on my face that something was up, but didn‚Äôt know what.</p>

<p>Then karma decided to kick in. As I almost made it out the door, the cards that I loosely placed inside of my shirt just fell out.</p>

<p>The girl behind the counter couldn‚Äôt believe that I tried to do this. I had never felt so ridiculous. All I could think about was what was the point of doing this? Why did I even do it? The thrill of it was there at first I‚Äôm sure, but I don‚Äôt remember that. I do remember the feeling of getting caught.</p>

<p>I could never show my face there again. The rest of the summer we hung out in front of a store in another part of the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Still really dig those cards though.</p>
