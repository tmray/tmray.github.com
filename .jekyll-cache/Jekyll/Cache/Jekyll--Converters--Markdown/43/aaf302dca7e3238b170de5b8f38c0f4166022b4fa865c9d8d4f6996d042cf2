I"†<p>Thatâ€™s the text or IM that I send people when their name shows up in my daily journal.</p>

<p>I had been using a site called ohlife.com for years that did a simple thing. It sent you and email at the end of the day with the subject line:</p>

<p><em>â€œHow was your day today?â€</em></p>

<p>When you opened the email it would say,</p>

<p><em>â€œA year ago today you wrote this.â€</em></p>

<p>Showing next what had been written and sent same day last year.</p>

<p>You respond to it and send it back. Simple.</p>

<p>It wasnâ€™t an app. It was just an email. Once I got over the fact it got R.E.M.â€™s â€œLosing my religionâ€ in my head because of itâ€™s site name, I looked forward to it.</p>

<p>Sometimes surprised me with things I didnâ€™t think were already a year old or things I forgot I was going to try.</p>

<p>My friends and family would even tell me â€œremember to put that in your thing!â€ They liked when I would send them update when their name showed up.</p>

<p>The site closed down this year. I needed to find a way to carry on this ritual I enjoyed so much.</p>

<p>I tried a couple of different methods to recreate this. None that I liked really.</p>

<p>Then I upgraded gmail to the new Inbox version. It has a snooze.</p>

<p>My method now. I send email to myself with my journal for today. Then I open it and snooze it for one year. When it comes back, I will respond again.</p>
