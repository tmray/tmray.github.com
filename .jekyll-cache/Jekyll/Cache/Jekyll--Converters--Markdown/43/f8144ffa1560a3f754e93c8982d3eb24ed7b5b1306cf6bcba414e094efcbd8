<p>I was out at the studio with my friend Rob. It was a cold October night. And at one point I went outside to have a cigarette.</p>

<p>The door to our recording studio is at the end of a long alleyway between two buildings that leads out to a sidewalk. And there‚Äôs not really any lighting there.</p>

<p>As I walked I thought I saw something lying there. Of course at first, me being paranoid, I thought it was a dead animal or something. But it wasn‚Äôt.</p>

<p>What was laying there was a pile of clothes. Now I‚Äôm not talking a laundry basket of clothes, what was there was specifically, a pair of grey sweatpants and one of those hippie wool hooded pullovers.</p>

<p>First after staring at the clothes, I looked down the street one way and then turned and looked down the street the other way. Nobody was around.</p>

<p>Just to make sure that I wasn‚Äôt going crazy and seeing things I went inside and got Rob. Had him come with me to witness the pile of clothes that I saw. They were still there. They were real.</p>

<p>He did the same thing as me and look down the street one way and look down the other. And again we didn‚Äôt see anybody.</p>

<p>We both agreed it was very strange. And we were both confused and concerned at the same time. What the hell are these clothes doing here?</p>

<p>Anyway there was nothing more we could do so we went inside.</p>

<p>At the end of the night we had kind of forgotten all about it. As we left and walked out into the street, both Rob and I stopped at the same time and turned around. The clothes that were in the pile there before were gone!?</p>

<p>What in the living hell is going on? No one would come by and be like, ‚ÄúHey, a pile of street clothes! Sweet!‚Äù and take them?</p>

<p>I just thought the whole thing was very strange.</p>
