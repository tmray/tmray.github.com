I"Ó<p>Truth be told Iâ€™ve actually thought about this situation before. Iâ€™ve asked friends about it. What would it be like to know a magician?</p>

<p>Today I got a glimpse of that answer.</p>

<p>It wasnâ€™t the magician I was expecting though. I expected a <strong>David Copperfield</strong> or a <strong>David Blaine</strong> type. One that takes it maybe too seriously.</p>

<p>I pictured it more this way. Even when doing something simple likeâ€“ passing the salt, their hands get all swoopy and dramatic as they hand it over.</p>

<p>What I got today was more of a <strong>Doug Henning</strong>. He was more the hippy magician. Or as he would say illusionist.</p>

<p>It was still quite the experience.</p>

<p>I was at a store returning something and greeted by a man with his hair in a ponytail on top of his head and a braided beard. He was very nice and helpful. The term â€œno worries, no worriesâ€ was used like the period at the end of each sentence.</p>

<p>As I walked with him to another area in the store I noticed a wooden stick in his back pocket. Thought it was a drumstick. He kept swinging it around during conversation.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s when he worked into the conversation, â€œDo you like magic?â€</p>

<p>I of course had to ask him to repeat himself because who expects that to be asked? Needed to make sure I heard it right.</p>

<p>He of course responded with â€œno worries, no worries.â€</p>

<p>Then started to pitch to me his magic act and told me when he performs most weeks. It started to dawn on me, the stick in his pocket was a wand!</p>

<p>But I have to say he did try make a connection with me while I was at the store. He helped me, we did what I needed to do. Then after getting to know me in those few minutes, told me what he does and asked me to check it out if I like.</p>

<p>While it was weird, I wasnâ€™t annoyed that he did it. It was personable. And now I know where to see him.</p>

<p>I mean, Iâ€™m not gonna go. But I respect the way he tried.</p>
