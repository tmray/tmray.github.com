<p>So this commercial, I saw it just the other day. It had the song ‚ÄúBeth‚Äù by <strong>KISS</strong> playing in the background.</p>

<p>It reminded me of two things.</p>

<p>The first was, this is the only song the drummer <strong>Peter Criss</strong> from the band did that was any good.</p>

<p>The second, was something I thought only I had done. I would re-write the lyrics for it with another girls name and give it to them as a poem.</p>

<p>What I mean is this. When I was in grade school I was a huge KISS fan. And when I listened to the song I knew it was a love song, I didn‚Äôt understand it, but I knew by the tone it was a love song.</p>

<p>I was interested in a girl, I think her name was Lisa. I got a piece of paper, took the vinyl record out of the sleeve and played the song.</p>

<p>Then on the carpet, using the album cover as a flat surface I would write out the lyrics to the song (what I understood of them), replacing the word ‚ÄúBeth‚Äù with ‚ÄúLisa‚Äù of course.</p>

<p>I thought I was so clever to have thought of this.</p>

<p>After seeing this recent commercial, I told that story to a few people I knew. Turns out some of them had also done this growing up. Down to using the cover as a flat surface.</p>

<p>What really made me think was this ‚Äì I can see where I did this on those old albums when I look at them.</p>

<p>When people search for vintage vinyl, do they see this? Do they look for it? The indentation from a kids pencil, pressing hard the words of love embossed on the cover of an old album?</p>
