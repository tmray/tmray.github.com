<p>Yesterday I wrote about <a href="/2015/08/25/weather-like-doctor-sax/">the time a friend and I found the book <strong>Doctor Sax</strong> at a used bookstore</a>.</p>

<p>Today I got a text from that friend asking to meet up at lunch. He had moved back here around 2005 from Portland.</p>

<p>When I met him he handed me something. Told me he saw this somewhere yesterday and knew that I’d like it.</p>

<p>It was an old hard cover book of collected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Arno"><strong>Peter Arno</strong></a> cartoons.</p>

<p>How strange? The day I thought of that story.</p>

<p>This artists style is right in line with what I like. Much like <a href="https://twitter.com/deanhaspiel"><strong>Dean Haspiel</strong></a> who I’ve mentioned before. Also similar to <a href="https://instagram.com/andicomics/"><strong>Andi Watson</strong></a>, another great artist.</p>

<p>The simplistic yet styled cartoon people in them are what do it for me. They can be comfortable in a serious setting yet be completely at home in something that is just absurd.</p>

<p>And the rough texture of the outlines and inking is what really makes it my favorite over all. Big thick course pencil-like lines.</p>

<p>A really great thing to get a copy of.</p>
