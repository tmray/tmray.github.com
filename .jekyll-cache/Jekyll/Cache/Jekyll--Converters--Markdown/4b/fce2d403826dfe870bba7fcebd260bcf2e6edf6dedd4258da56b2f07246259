I"E<p>That’s what I like to call it.</p>

<p>The past couple of weeks things have been different. My normal schedule has been off it’s course. It will only be that way for a few more days but I’m starting to feel it.</p>

<p>I only have a few things that I really like to accomplish in a day, and I am. I’ve just had to do it differently because of this.</p>

<p>Things like this happen from time to time in many ways and they can consume my head. It doesn’t feel right. Like something is stuck in there.</p>

<p>The same way it feels when you try to start a car when the battery is dead. You stop and think to yourself– it’s gonna work this time, and try it again.</p>

<p>That’s the thing I’ve dubbed disruption mind here.</p>

<p>It can bleed over into other things and just make you question it all.</p>

<p>Editing,I felt it while editing my podcast.</p>

<p>Musically, working on writing a new song last night. Nothing seemed right. Something was missing.</p>

<p>Client work, no longer seemed to be delivering right. Seemed fine then it wasn’t. Started second guessing what I had created and researched.</p>

<p>Usually I can see things pretty optimistically. Even try to take it as an oppertunity to learn something, most cases.</p>

<p>But when head gets stopped up like this with disruption. Like that car, seems stuck.</p>

<p>I know it won’t last long. Never does. Something changes it and ideas start flowing again.</p>

<p>Sense of relief, like when you finally get that car battery jumped and it starts? We all know what that’s like. Everything seems normal again.</p>
