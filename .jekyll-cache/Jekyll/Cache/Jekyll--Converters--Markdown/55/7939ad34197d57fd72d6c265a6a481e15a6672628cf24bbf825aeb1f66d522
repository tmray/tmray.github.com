I"Ð<p>I am the singer/songwriter for the band <a href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com">Lorenzoâ€™s Music</a>.<br />
Iâ€™m also run the show <a href="https://www.tomrayswebsite.com">Tom Rayâ€™s Art Podcast</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Lorenzoâ€™s Music</strong> is described as the band Spoon if it were produced by Tom Waits.
All of the music is under creative commons and available for commercial use.</p>

<p><strong>Tom Rayâ€™s Art Podcast</strong> is an interview show I started to meet artists and creators from professional to beginners and talk about what they do.</p>

<p>This blog is just a place to post my thoughts.<br />
These may involve, but are not limited to:<br />
things Iâ€™m working on, artistic ventures, experiences, or the virtually out of nowhere pop-culture references that get stuck in my head.</p>
