I"K<p>I’ve never really been good at typing. But I’ve gotten better over the years.</p>

<p>Well… Let’s just say I’m faster at it these days, but I still need to look at the keyboard while I’m doing it. Less than I used to though.</p>

<p>I don’t know what it is. I’ve tried different learning methods and followed tutorials but I just can’t get it.</p>

<p>Typing on my phone however, I’ve become increasingly good at.</p>

<p>Case in point; ever since I started this blog, just to test that theory I’ve done the entire thing on my phone. I feel like I can do it faster, and with less distractions. I also feel like I can really get my groove on when I type on the phone.</p>

<p>There’s just something about it. I can tell when I read it back. What I say sounds more natural.</p>

<p><strong>Jack White</strong> does something interesting that I read about. When he plays live, he sets his instruments and gear further apart and in different places each time. That way he never gets too settled and lazy. Keeps him from falling into a pattern or just going through the motions.</p>

<p>I guess what I’m trying to say is whatever medium I work in I should just find the tool that helps use it best.</p>

<p>And then, after a while try to expand from that. Learn what I originally set out to do when it becomes too comfortable.</p>
