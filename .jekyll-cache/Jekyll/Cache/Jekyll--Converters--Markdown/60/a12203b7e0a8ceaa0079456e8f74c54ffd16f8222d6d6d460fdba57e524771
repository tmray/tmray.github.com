<p>I mean really. Think back on that song for those that know.</p>

<p>It goes along, catchy, poppy. Then it gets to the solo and for like 15 seconds the song is nonsense. And Iâ€™ve never heard anyone say they thought twice about it?</p>

<p>Iâ€™m gonna say what I think it is. Now keep in mind this is based on my own conspiracy theory derived from what I claim to remember from this period of time.</p>

<p>I recall that <strong>David Lee Roth</strong> hated how <strong>Eddie Van Halen</strong> was leaning in a synth heavy rock direction. I want to even say I remember hearing Roth said youâ€™re the greatest guitar player in the world. No one wants to hear you play keyboard.</p>

<p>So based on what I think, when they recorded the song Eddie said: fine you want a guitar solo? Iâ€™ll give you a guitar solo!</p>

<p>Switched the time signature, picked up his guitar, banged on it for a few seconds and set it back down.</p>

<p>I mean seriously. listen to it. And weâ€™ve just all accepted it because well, it was Eddie Van Halen.</p>

<p>That has always been my running theory.</p>

<p>Now if you look, here is what wikipedia says about it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>although the song does contain a guitar solo, whichÂ Eddie Van HalenÂ claims is his favorite solo he never wrote. This refers to the fact that it was spliced together from multiple takes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Multiple takes? Again, its like 15 seconds long. Compared to what I said it sounds even more passive aggressive.</p>
