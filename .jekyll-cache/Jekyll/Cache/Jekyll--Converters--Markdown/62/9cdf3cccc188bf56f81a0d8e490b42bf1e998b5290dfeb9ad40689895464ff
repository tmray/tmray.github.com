I"ó<p>I love when realization happens. Something simple that takes a mundane task or thing you do over &amp; over to a sense of disbelief. Because of something stupid you just didnâ€™t think to do. Your world changes. So many possibilities. All because you were shown something.</p>

<p>This I love.</p>

<p>Here is a current example. Podcasts, I have so many to listen to. I donâ€™t have time to hear all the ones I want to hear. Would need to stop listening to one to replace another just to fit it in. Told a friend this when he recommended a new one to me. Then he saysâ€“ â€œthatâ€™s why I speed listen to mineâ€.</p>

<p>What the hell is that? Tells me itâ€™s like speed reading but with audio. Turn the player speed up to 2x and you can fit more in.</p>

<p>I never would have thought of that!</p>

<p>Sure it takes a few minutes to adjust to the way it sounds, but it changes everything. Not bogged down with overwhelming playlist anymore.</p>

<p>This is the type of thing to remember.</p>

<p>When you do something, share how its done. Even if it seems like itâ€™s obvious and you tell yourself, â€œeveryone must already know thisâ€? Because someone is always new at something somewhere and you may just open their eyes to a whole different opportunity.</p>
