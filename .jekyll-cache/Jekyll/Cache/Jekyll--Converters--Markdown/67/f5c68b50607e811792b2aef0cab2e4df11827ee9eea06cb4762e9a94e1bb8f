I"ı<p>Ok so I have been a person that, in the past, has said â€œI think everything happens for a reasonâ€.</p>

<p>When I say that, it was usually because something bad happened and I believe whatever it is you get through it and learn from it.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve never meant it in the trivial way itâ€™s sometimes used like â€“ if itâ€™s raining on the day you decide to take up jogging, you think the universe is trying to tell you something.</p>

<p>That being said, I do think that there is an elaborate orchestration to life. We exist and have complex circulatory systems. How? Thatâ€™s crazy right!?</p>

<p>So, why canâ€™t I think ghosts and parallel forces are helping us do things? Even small things. Because you never know what significance it can have later on.</p>

<p>An example, (all be it a stupid one); several years ago I took a trip to Texas. While we were there I was looking for a comic book store. Instead the cab driver took me to an independent book shop. I guess he thought it was a comic shop.</p>

<p>Anyway, he had already left so I figured Iâ€™d go inside and check it out. It was a cool place but no comics.</p>

<p>Then on one shelf I saw what looked like a graphic novel that was filled with several indie comic publishers stories. It was saran wrapped with a few small indie â€œzineâ€ books as well.</p>

<p>I figured what the hell, I can read it on the plane ride home. So I got it, put it in my bag and forgot all about it. Never even opened it.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today, Iâ€™ve been thinking about pursuing comic book art again. I was researching ways to learn more about visual storytelling in the page panels and layout.</p>

<p>One artist I looked up recommends this book â€œCartooning - Philosophy and Practiceâ€ by <strong>Ivan Brunetti</strong>. Says itâ€™s a whole class course in a small paperback book.</p>

<p>I look at the cover and I feel like Iâ€™ve seen it before?</p>

<p>You guessed it. It was one of the things I thought was a zine wrapped with that book I bought years ago.</p>

<p>I dug out the package it came in from my closet and opened it. Turns out the book is really inspired and insightful. I donâ€™t think I would have purchased it otherwise.</p>

<p>So why did I? What made me think to get it that day? Was there fate involved? Did some force really make me go to that shop, knowing I would need that book later in my life?</p>

<p>I canâ€™t explain why things happen but they have to start somewhere.</p>
