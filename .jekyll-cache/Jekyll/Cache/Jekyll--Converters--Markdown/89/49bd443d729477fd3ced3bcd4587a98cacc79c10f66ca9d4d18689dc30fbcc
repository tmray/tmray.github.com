I"æ<p>Feels like everything is just all over the place. Iâ€™ve been preparing for project Iâ€™m doing for weeks. Collecting data from market research, examples, swipe files, the whole bit.</p>

<p>Laid out exactly what we wanted to show could be accomplished. But when it comes time to do it I feel like everything I know, everything Iâ€™ve learned is lost. Iâ€™m doing what needs to be done and moving forward. Itâ€™s just my head I think.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been preparing, maybe over preparing, and to feel this way seems silly.</p>

<p>Need to write down what happens and what was done to learn from later. Is that just creating more chaos? I hope not.</p>

<p>What I hope is this feeling will breed familiarity. Like looking at a blank screen for first time to write a book. Self doubt &amp; fear of failure are surely what everyone starts with the first time. A callus that needs to be built so you can power through this as time goes on I suspect.</p>

<p>Need to stop blaming disorganization.</p>
