I"¸<p>Years ago I decided to stop pirating software and move to open source tools.</p>

<p>It was difficult at first but you adapt.</p>

<p>During this time itâ€™s gotten a lot more mature. Even a bit more well known as open source projects have become more popular.</p>

<p>I started to seek out distributions that had more focus on these tools. One of them was <strong>Ubuntu Studio</strong>.</p>

<p>Its a Linux operating system geared directly towards musicians, video makers &amp; designers.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been very happy with it and what it has installed right out of the box.</p>

<p><strong>Ardour</strong> for multi-track recording. <strong>Inkscape</strong> and <strong>Gimp</strong> for artwork. <strong>Kdenlive</strong> for video, among other things.</p>

<p>They even have a live bootable DVD you can download to try it on your computer first without installing it.</p>

<p>On the podcast that I do, Music Manumit, we were lucky enough this week to talk to Kaj, the person leading this project.</p>

<p>You can have a listen to the interview on the site. <a href="http://www.musicmanumit.com/2015/08/ubuntu-studio-150816-music-manumit.html">Ubuntu Studio - 150816 - Music Manumit Podcast</a></p>
