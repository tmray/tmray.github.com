<p>So I was thinking about building Jekyll sites since hosting is soo easy with github pages. But how would an author use it?</p>

<p>Then I discovered <a href="http://prose.io" title="link">prose.io</a></p>

<p>So Iâ€™m testing out this post to see if it may bridge the gap for non-developers, who just want a website without having to maintain a CMS. So thatâ€™s what this post is. A test.</p>

<p>I already use the <a href="http://faudroids.org/MrHyde/" title="link">MrHyde mobile app</a> to do this on android. I just needed one for the browser.</p>

<p>It even looks like it has a front-matter option in the menu to use. Although itâ€™s called a meta-data editor which was not obvious at first. But it works!</p>

<p>Cool find.</p>
