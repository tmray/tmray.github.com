I"	<p>I took a typing class when I was in high school. No. Let me rephrase that…</p>

<p>I enrolled in a typing class when I was in high school. I wanted the credits and I heard it was an easy course. And it was. Because I never went.</p>

<p>I never even knew where the classroom was.</p>

<p>It was before lunch so I always left early with friends. Thinking to myself, I’m never going to need to know how to type? Not knowing how engrained computers &amp; technology would be later.</p>

<p>It did turn out to be an easy course. End of semester I got a C. For not even going? Always wondered how that was possible?</p>

<p>Now I know taking a simple interest in this class would have made my life easier later on.</p>

<p>Dumb kid thinking he knew everything. 
Now adult, looking back at himself with fathers eyes pissed off that he gets it now.</p>

<p>I try not to say no to anything I could learn just from this one memory. Always looking at it thinking– I may be able to use or appropriate this knowledge down the line.</p>
