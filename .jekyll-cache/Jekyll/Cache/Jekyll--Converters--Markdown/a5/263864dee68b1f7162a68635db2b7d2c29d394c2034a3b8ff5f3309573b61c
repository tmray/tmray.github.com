I"><p>Talked with musician Chris Zabriskie <a href="http://www.musicmanumit.com/2015/09/another-chris-zabriskie-150913-music.html">on my podcast this week</a>.</p>

<p>He’s put out several albums and his songs have been used in many different places. From <strong>Cartoon Network</strong> to <strong>Nissan</strong> and even used in a <strong>porn movie</strong>. All while distributed under a <strong>creative commons license</strong>.</p>

<p>We’ve had him on the show several times and he’s a great guy to talk to and learn things from.</p>

<p>This time we had him on to talk about his new album <a href="http://amzn.to/1NqSMhs">Thoughtless</a>.</p>

<p>During the conversation he told me an idea he was thinking of when he made the album. He wanted to transfer it to a vhs tape. Plug directly into a VCR and record the audio to it, using a stack of vhs tapes that he had.</p>

<p>I thought that sounded cool. I had this thought in my head as to how it would sound. Digital imperfections that would make it sound unique. Sounds that couldn’t be achieved through natural ways or effects. I got really excited that it!</p>

<p>I texted my guitarist who also runs a studio, asking him if he had ever tried that? Wondering what he thought about it?</p>

<p>He just texted me back, <em>“Ha! Yes I have. Why?”</em></p>

<p>I explained what I was thinking and the conversation I had with Chris about it.</p>

<p>He just asked why would you want to do something like that? Said its more of a hassle and I would probably be disappointed with the result.</p>

<p>Maybe I would. But, Mark works on audio with people everyday. What I was asking him is the kind of sound he tries to prevent.</p>

<p>I guess I just like the way the concept sounded.</p>

<p>You get to tell people that you did something like that, transfered it to vhs. While maybe not a good idea, it makes a great story.</p>

<p>It worked on me. When I heard about this all I could think was, this guy really thinks outside the box!</p>

<p>I still want to try it. I think the way you do things can get people motivated about what it is.</p>
