I"4<p>I got the chance to talk with <strong>Ethan Tufts</strong> this weekend <a href="https://www.musicmanumit.com/2015/10/state-shirt-2-151025-music-manumit.html">on my podcast.</a></p>

<p>Ethan, is a musician that goes by the name <strong>State Shirt</strong>. Had him on the show before and this time he was back to talk about his <a href="https://music.stateshirt.com/album/lost-hills"><strong>new album “Lost Hills”</strong></a>.</p>

<p>This isn’t out of the ordinary to have a guest on promoting a new album. In fact, it’s usually one of the main reasons we have someone on the show.</p>

<p>But being a podcast focusing primarily on <strong>creative commons musicians</strong>, we don’t normally talk to people that promote themselves as other bands do.</p>

<p>That’s not to say bands we talk to don’t promote their music. But a lot of creative commons musicians don’t necessarily do it for fame. They just do it– to do it.</p>

<p>It’s one of the things I love about the culture.</p>

<p>But people do contact me with questions, asking for ways they could get their music out there and still maintain status in the creative commons realm.</p>

<p>So when we get a guest that has, hit the pavement. Sent out his stuff. Knocked on some doors, things like that. I take the opportunity to get more of that process out of them.</p>

<p>I got so wrapped up in this, I didn’t even get a chance to talk to him about his “Seedie Release” concept. If you order his physical CD it comes with seeds you can plant.</p>

<p>Get it? “Seedie”?</p>

<p>I love meeting people that find different and unique ways of doing this. It’s one of the best reasons for doing the show.</p>
