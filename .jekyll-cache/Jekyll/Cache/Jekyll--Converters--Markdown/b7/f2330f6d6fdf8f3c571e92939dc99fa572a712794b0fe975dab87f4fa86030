I"<p>##Think about it for a second.</p>

<p>The plot of the movie <strong>Roadhouse</strong> with <strong>Patrick Swayzie</strong> is basically this:</p>

<p>A small community that seems to be just a general store and 2 bars. One man extorts money from this general store, that can barely get by. Yet, this seems to be enough to pay his crew of 4 men to go there and collect it every week.</p>

<p>The plot of the 80â€™s show <strong>The A-Team</strong> is usually this:</p>

<p>A shop or family owned business is being extorted by someone who leads a group of guys. While the family business barely makes enough to get by, this bad guy wants to get them out of the picture so they can corner the market and get rich.</p>

<p>I feel these stories should be taught in business classes.</p>
