I"Z<p>Maybe because of the <a href="https://tmray.github.io/2015/07/21/Taking-the-plunge/">new venture I’m entering</a> I’m thinking so much about keeping notes for thoughts &amp; ideas.</p>

<p>I realize this is the 3rd post like it. Don’t want it to seem like this is some, get things done blog. Just on my mind I guess.</p>

<p>Writing down what you think somewhere is better than nothing.</p>

<p>Thing is, a lot of ideas come to me when I ride my bike. I don’t know if it’s because all you can do is pedal so the mind wanders? The passing people? Scents in the air? But most things come to me during a bike ride. Lyrics. Ideas to try. Concepts for things I’m working on &amp; so on.</p>

<p>I just posted about <a href="https://tmray.github.io/2015/07/23/Notebooks/">having a pocket notebook</a>. But if I stopped every time to write thoughts down, getting around would take forever. Used to think I could remember thought until I got to where I’m going. Never did.</p>

<p>My simple trick involves headphones with mic, Google mobile app &amp; Google Keep.</p>

<p>When I think of something I click and hold headphone mic to activate Google search. After the tone I leave a message.</p>

<p>Just say “Note to self” to add it to Google Keep. That’s it.</p>

<p>Later you can view your notes on computer or phone and do what you want with them.</p>
