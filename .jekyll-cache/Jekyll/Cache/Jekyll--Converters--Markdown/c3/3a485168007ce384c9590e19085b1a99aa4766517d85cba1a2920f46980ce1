I"<p>I’ve been a comic book fan for many years and have always wanted to go to a comic con.</p>

<p>I usually remember that it’s happening after the fact, missing out and thinking next year.</p>

<p>After that happening again when I missed another San Diego comic con I was determined to get in the next one I saw coming up. Any where.</p>

<p>Found Wizard World in Chicago. Near by drive, happening this year, done. Booked it.</p>

<p>When I went there this weekend I had an idea of what to expect from things I’ve seen.</p>

<p>This is different when its in front of you. The fact of walking around a corner in a hotel and coming face to face with person fully decked out as Captain America.</p>

<p>Is it OK to laugh? I mean you can’t just pretend when you see that and act like everything is all chill right?</p>

<p>After heading to convention I realized that they will stop to pose with anyone. So being noticed is expected. It’s just not something my brain is used to having to figure out.</p>

<p>Aside from that, I had only a few goals I wanted to accomplish when I got there. On the roster there were a couple people appearing that I wanted to meet.</p>

<p>First one was artist <strong>Dean Haspiel</strong>. I discovered him years ago.</p>

<p>Before it was so easy to create a webcomic online he started a collective called Act-i-vate.</p>

<p>It was a collaborative with other artists that made some amazing webcomics and his was a series called Billy Dogma. I really dug his style and wanted to meet him.</p>

<p>Found him right away. He signed a book for me. I told him I was from Madison. He had an interesting story he told me about a kid he knew growing up from here.</p>

<p>Dean is from New York, when he came to visit his friend he took him to a Woolworths store.</p>

<p>He was all excited to show him that it had an escalator. Which was pretty funny. I’d like to think we’ve gotten a little more with the times since then, I hope.</p>

<p>Next was <strong>Jodi Sweeten</strong>, aka <strong>Stephanie from Full House</strong>.</p>

<p>My son was a big fan of this show growing up. When she asked who to make the autograph out to, I told her to sign it for my son. I said I really wanted to meet her just to make him jealous.</p>

<p><strong>Burt Reynolds</strong> was there as well but sadly any opportunities to see him were all sold out. I was pretty bummed about that.</p>

<p>After a full day of seeing other things, headed back to the hotel.</p>

<p>Walking towards the side entrance I looked at a guy standing there and recognized him and pointed like, ‘hey aren’t you?…’</p>

<p>His first facial expression was that of someone thinking he should run. Then I just said, “You’re from the show <strong>The Wire</strong>, right?”</p>

<p>It was <strong>Seth Gilliam</strong>.</p>

<p>My wife and I are currently in the middle of season 4 of the show right now. Saying that he then looked relieved and said yes and talked with us for a bit.</p>

<p>I have not watched <strong>The Walking Dead</strong>, and I guess he is on that show right now.</p>

<p>After telling people I know that do watch that series I understand why he was first thinking to run. I guess from what I’ve heard his character is not a very liked man.</p>

<p>After talking a bit I thanked him, shook his hand and went inside.</p>

<p>Later thinking back on this day I realized something. I felt weird about wanting to take a picture with any of these people as I met them.</p>

<p>I thought it would seem intrusive. So I never did.</p>

<p>Is that weird?</p>

<p>I’m happy with my stories that I have about meeting these people. But everyone asks why I didn’t take a picture. The entire event is about taking pictures of things.</p>

<p>I guess I just felt it would take away from talking to them as a person I think.</p>

<p>But I did get a kick ass picture with the <strong>Knight Rider</strong> car. I mean that’s just a cool thing to do right!?</p>
