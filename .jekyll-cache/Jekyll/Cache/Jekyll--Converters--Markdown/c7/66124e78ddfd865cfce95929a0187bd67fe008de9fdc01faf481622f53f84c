I"m<p>Now I’m not talking about names like <strong>Edith</strong> or <strong>Hortense</strong> or <strong>Ulysses</strong>.</p>

<p>I’m talking ridiculous names, like the kind they had in the 1940’s B-movie serials. Names like <strong>“Speed”</strong> or <strong>“Flash”</strong> or <strong>“Hoot”</strong>. Essentially names that sounded like a verb.</p>

<p>I like to watch those old 1940’s movies. There’s a bunch on Amazon. And it’s just so silly when they actually refer to the person by their, what I’m calling, “verb” name.</p>

<p>I miss half the movie because I’m trying to understand, going over in my head thinking:</p>

<p><em>“did their parents actually name them that? Or is it just a ridiculous nickname that somebody gave them?”</em></p>

<p>And if it’s true, if that was actually a name someone gave them when they were born. Why did it stop? At what point in human existence did people just eventually stop naming their children that?</p>

<p>Or was it just a ridiculous naming convention created by writers?</p>

<p>I’d love to know the etymology of that particular trend.</p>
