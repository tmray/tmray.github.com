<p>About 8 years ago this picture was taken.</p>

<p><strong>Back story first:</strong>
I worked at an ad agency. I shared an office with a guy who‚Äôs wife worked at a school. She was involved with a production of ‚ÄúThe Wizard of Oz‚Äù they were putting on and he made a suit for the tin man.</p>

<p>One day we were going to lunch and that tin man suit was in his car. I saw it, and of course, needed to put it on and dance the robot.</p>

<p>All makes total sense right?</p>

<p>We took a picture, I uploaded it to my Flickr stream. End of story.</p>

<p>Until, eight years later.</p>

<p>I get an email the other day from someone, thanking me for sharing my photo and putting it under creative commons license. There‚Äôs also a link attached telling me that <a href="https://humanitydeathwatch.com/2016/02/03/as-joke-human-employee-given-chance-to-outperform-robot-replacement/">they had just used it in an article</a>.</p>

<p>Now, this isn‚Äôt out of the ordinary since most of the things I post, like music, pictures and art, I put under the same <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">creative commons license</a>.</p>

<p>It basically tells people they can use what I post, but need to give me credit for doing so. I‚Äôve been able to network and see my stuff used all around the world in interning ways because of this.</p>

<p>Now back to this email‚Ä¶</p>

<p>I was a bit confused why, what seemed to be a news site, would want to use this this photo of all things.</p>

<p>Turns out it was a publication like ‚ÄúThe Onion‚Äù, more of a satirical news site. The article tells a story of a day when robots rule the work place and a human decides to work among them undetected.</p>

<p>So that‚Äôs how that all happened. And truthfully it‚Äôs not the strangest thing I‚Äôve been attributed on.</p>
