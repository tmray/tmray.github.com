<p>I remember the actor that played all of the adult male characters on the show <strong>You canâ€™t do that on television</strong>.</p>

<p>There was the messy drunk, a gross cook, a conniving boss or a dictator to name a few.</p>

<p>Whatever happened to him? I know he passed away a few years back. I mean career-wise.</p>

<p>He was like the first character actor I was ever aware of. Most people that remember the show, didnâ€™t even know it was the same guy playing all those parts.</p>

<p>He was like my 80â€™s pop culture <strong>De Niro</strong>. I would have liked to see him in some dark comedy film.</p>
