I"°	<p>Just when I felt like it was finally summer, the cold sets in. Itâ€™s like someone flipped a switch that effected the Midwest.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve mentioned before my position on winter, questioning why I live here. But thatâ€™s not what this is about.</p>

<p>One summer in my youth I read the book <a href="http://amzn.to/1EhtGju"><strong>On the road by Jack Kerouac</strong></a>.</p>

<p>It was a 1970â€™s reprint I found in a resale shop bin. Like most people, after reading it I wanted to get in a car and drive across the country. So me and a friend did just that.</p>

<p>We took off in his pick up truck and headed to Portland Oregon to visit a friend.</p>

<p>I shit you not, we made the trip in 24 hours. No stops, just drive.</p>

<p>When we arrived, walked into my friends apartment, he handed me a beer. The next thing I remember is waking up the next morning kneeling on the floor face down with that same beer in my hand. Passed out instantly.</p>

<p>It was the tail end of summer. After about a week we headed back home.</p>

<p>At home the seasons were starting to cool. Autumn.</p>

<p>I started reading the book while riding in the moving truck I worked in. Itâ€™s a very different book than on the road.</p>

<p>He describes a childhood in a small town and a mysterious entity that haunts him.</p>

<p>The description of this time was just so close to the way things were as I rode in this truck. It stuck.</p>

<p>This weather always reminds me of this book. And instead of my hate for the cold. This change has a tendency to inspire. Itâ€™s like a time portal that takes me back to that moment.</p>
