I"'<p>I’m not necessarily a shy person. I can get in front of people, make a jackass of myself. No problem.</p>

<p>Being a musician, a podcaster &amp; artist I am comfortable with personal work out there in front of people.</p>

<p>When I do those things I know what I like, how I sound and what I want to do. What I think works and what don’t.</p>

<p>Here’s the thing. After all of that is done, need to promote to show people. I know where I want it to be seen and done the work to get it there.</p>

<p>When I try to tell people they should see it and why- with advertisement or social post, I never know what to say. And it always sounds phony.</p>

<p>Hell, get me in a room with people and I’m not shy starting conversations. Why should this part be so hard? I assume this is same reason why not everyone can act. Seems insincere when I do it.</p>

<p>So I’m trying to find that voice. Trying to be able to be myself, even when I’m trying to convince people for the first time.</p>

<p>I hope I find why this stupid thing gives such anxiety?</p>
