<p>I just saw someone with a box of these. My mind took a second to even put together why I recognized them.</p>

<p>I think Iâ€™ve mentioned before the lame ass things like <strong>shrinky dinks</strong> that where out when I was a kid. Are they even considered games? Toys? Art?</p>

<p>Colorforms were just a background picture on smooth cardboard surface. Vinyl character cut outs pressed on it to create the scene. They didnâ€™t even really stick which didnâ€™t matter since you laid them down flat anyway.</p>

<p>But I had several. Happy Days, Welcome Back Kotter, a KISS one for cryinâ€™ out loud!</p>

<p>Yet looking at them I still think theyâ€™re kinda cool.</p>

<p>They did have a certain style. And you gotta give credit to someone that looked at the concept of paper dolls and thought, how can we build from this?</p>
