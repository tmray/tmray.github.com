<p>My skin and my feet become uncomfortable in doctors offices.</p>

<hr />

<p>Ive been leaning on drawing lately to help take my mind off of things. I’m currently reading a lesson book called <a href="https://amzn.to/2qjhjBH">“Cartooning philosophy and practice” by <strong>Ivan Brunetti</strong></a>.</p>

<p>I hopped on Twitter the other day and streamed video of me going through lesson 4</p>

<p>The outcome is an 8 panel comic of a character made of shapes, a location, an object and an action.</p>
