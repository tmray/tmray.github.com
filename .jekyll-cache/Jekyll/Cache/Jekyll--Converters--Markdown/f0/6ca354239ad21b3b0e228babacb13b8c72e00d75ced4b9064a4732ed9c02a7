I"—<p>These are all things that have become creepy in my lifetime.</p>

<p>Ice cream trucks were an awesome thing to hear coming growing up. Now if you see one today we all think somethingâ€™s fishy. Trolling around the neighborhood. What changed in popular culture? Was there a story involved or is it just the concept.</p>

<p>In the case of RVs, for me, it was a story that did it. After <strong>Breaking Bad</strong> I canâ€™t help but think something illegal is inside that traveling motor home.</p>

<p>Back in high school, friends and I all wanted a van. It could lug tons of band gear. You could get drunk in back and not be seen. One friend eventually got one. Tricked it out with speaker stacks in the back. Party on wheels. It was fantastic.</p>

<p>Then I saw this one the other day and all I could think was, I assumed they were going to kidnap someone.</p>

<p>Do times change the view from stories and examples. Or do things from the past turn into ghost stories and boogymen naturally? Why do some become vintage and nostalgic?</p>
