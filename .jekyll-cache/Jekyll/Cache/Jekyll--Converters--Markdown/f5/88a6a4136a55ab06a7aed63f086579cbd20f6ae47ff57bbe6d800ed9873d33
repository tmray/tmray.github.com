<p><a href="http://lorenzosmusic.com">My band</a> played a show recently. It wasnâ€™t a normal show, it was part of a city wide event called <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/makemusicmadison?s=09">#MakeMusicMadison</a>. An event where, for one day, musicians pop up to play in various public places.</p>

<p>We were asked to play on a porch at someoneâ€™s house right off the lake at 8pm. One of the last shows of the day. Seemed like a fun thing to do, no pressure.</p>

<p>As the day arrived and we started setting up on the porch, it started to feel intimidating? Why was this? I looked around and there were maybe thirty or forty people hanging around. Just talking, having a good time.</p>

<p>So why was I suddenly so nervous? Iâ€™ve made a fool of myself in front of a much larger audience, with no problem.</p>

<p>Was it because this intimate setting was so close that it was like I was talking to them directly as I performed? I guess if I think about it, it would have been far more devastating to see people walk away from us in this situation.</p>

<p>Walking into it we had the attitude that if we were off that night it wasnâ€™t a huge deal. It was just for fun. But once we got there it seemed far more exposed.</p>

<p>When we finished, that also proved how a setting like this is different. Everyone was very personal. Came right up to us and told us how they liked it. At a larger show I can walk right through the crowd and no one says a thing.</p>

<p>I feel it was good to face a fear like that for such a pay off. Even though going into it we had no idea it would be such a terrifying thing.</p>
