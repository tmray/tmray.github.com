<p>In my work-a-day, 9to5 life I donâ€™t like to collaborate with people. Meaning, I do something and donâ€™t look for opinion. Not really wanting or need example of another way to do what I did. And its not a secret. Maybe you can relate?</p>

<p>Recently watched the movie â€œFrankâ€. About a musician looking for stardom. Finds band that just lost a member and singer has giant paper mache head. You know, the norm.<br />

Our protagonist, the new musician to the group, shows them song heâ€™s working on. 
They like the idea then step in front of his keyboard and start suggesting, do this or try this as he stands behind.</p>

<p>My Wife turns to me and says â€œthat must drive you nuts!â€</p>

<p>You would think. Given what I said before by all means I should hate that.</p>

<p>But I donâ€™t. Not in that situation.</p>

<p>Maybe because creatively I work with like minds I respect and choose to be around. I know theyâ€™ll make what I do better.</p>

<p>Work life: you donâ€™t choose people. Theyâ€™re just there. And end of day I would rather be done doing that.</p>

<p>Make things with people I want to make them with, I care more.</p>
