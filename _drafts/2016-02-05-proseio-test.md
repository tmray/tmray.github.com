## Trying to break free of a cms

So I was thinking about building Jekyll sites since hosing is soo cheap or easy with github pages. But how would an author use it?

Then I discovered [prose.io](http://prose.io "link")

So I'm testing out this post to see if it may bridge the gap for non-developers who just want a website without having to maintain a CMS. So that's what this post is. A test.

I already use the HYDE mobile app to do this, I just needed one for the browser.

Now I just need to see what it can do about the front-matter needed for design in a post.
