I just saw someone with a box of these. My mind took a second to even put together why I recognized them.

I think I've mentioned before the lame ass things like shrinkydinks that where out when I was a kid. Are they even considered games? Toys? Art?

Colorforms were just a background picture on smooth cardboard surface. Vinyl character cut outs pressed on it to create the scene. But they didn't stick and you laid them down flat anyway. 

But I had several. Happy Days, Welcome Back Kotter, a KISS one for cryin' out loud!

Yet looking at them I still think they're kinda cool. 

They did have a certain style. And you gotta give credit to someone that looked at the concept of paper dolls and thought, how can we build from this?
