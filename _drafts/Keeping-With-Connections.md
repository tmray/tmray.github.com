title: Keeping With Connections
---

One of the reasons I started the podcast I do, Music Manumit, is to learn more about creative commons music and meet other like minded people that do the same thing. And I have. I've meet so many that I don't remember all of them off the top of my head. And that's a problem. 

Friday I talked with the new head of the free music archive site, Cheyenne, who is a great person and has done a lot for the site in the time that she's been there. Though promotion, reaching out to people and reinvigorating the radio free culture podcast. Talking to her inspired me. Which is the whole point of doing interviews with people like her. 

I've talked to the last 3 people in her position at the site over the years and not kept in touch. why? I didn't even know until we scheduled the interview with Cheyenne that Andrea, the previous person had left. 

I have connections with so many of these people that I need to get better at keeping in touch. Talking to them about like minded projects and collaborating with them. Bring them in on ideas i have, because they, as I mentioned, are doing what I am too-- getting their stuff out there and wanting people to create from it and with it. We should all keep connected. Why wouldn't we?

First try at doing this was a cover of a song my band Lorenzo's Music made of the Biting Elbows song "Stampede". I had the singer on the podcast before and I thought it would be a good start. 

After doing recording and live video of song, I shared a link with him and he shared it to his people too. Being a creative commons song we were able to do this, no worries. 

Even this little bit of our connection made it a very successful experiment.

After that others that saw contacted me to use the song we did in their own way with their projects. Like we did.

I need to keep in touch more with people I meet or what's the point of doing?
