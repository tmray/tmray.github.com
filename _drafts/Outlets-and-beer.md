I know people that work and go home and maybe do something on the weekends. My parents are like that. I don't get that? Not trying to work towards something different in your free time. Seems foreign to me. 

Counterpoint, when I explain what I do with free time I'm the told same thing. So fair enough. 

I knew a guy once who was a machinist. He loved it. When I asked him what else he does or wants to do, he just looked at me funny. "What do you mean?" he said. He was doing it. It was all he wanted. Work, get paid & go home. And good for him, he was happy. It was all he wanted and I respect that.

I just need to do more I guess. 

I have what I call my second day. My day is split into 2 parts. Much so it seems 2 days in 1 for me. 

It goes like this. 

##First day

* Wake up for day job.
* Do that.
* Go home.
* Take a 30 minute nap.

##Second Day (still technically the same day)

* Wake up from nap.
* Workout (have to do this or I never fully wake back up).
* Make dinner.
* Then work on personal projects.

This is where I do things I think about all day. It can range from, write music or podcast show I do, make cartoons or art and so on. 

If I don't do that I get depressed. Sometimes it helps me shake things I keep thinking about that are dragging me down.  

Case in point, I had a particularly frustrating day at work. Even while driving to band practice I thought about it the whole drive. Wasted effort to think about it really. I'm not even sure I remember driving there I was so immersed in these thoughts. 

When I get in the room with other guys to create songs and ideas, I thought about nothing else. 

Then on drive home all I thought of was what we did and how to improve it. That's what should be on my mind in free time. I don't want to just watch TV and hope that the stories distract me. I want to **do** something I can say I accomplished at the end of the day. My second day.

Related to this night Eric, our keyboardist is a brew meister and he brought the first prototypes of the commercial beer that he's been working on. Put that on top of making something creative with people you know? Ain't a bad mix.
