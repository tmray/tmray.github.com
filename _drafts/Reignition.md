Building off of [what I wrote the other day](http://tmray.github.io/2015/07/12/Being-Too-Close-To-Know-It). The part about having skill set but using it in different way than originally intended. 

I taught myself how to do websites and code. Made a career of it for myself at different companies. But lately I've grown weary of it. Dread having to do this for other people. Want to spend free time from work focusing on art and music. 

Recently this knowledge and background has been something people in my circles want to know. Need help doing. 

I get excited when I think about different ways that I can apply things I learned from grinding proprietary job to open a friends eyes in amazement at how they can expand their knowledge. Achieve something they thought would be a huge hurdle to jump. 

Even just creating this simple Jekyll blog has ignited my want for something more. 

Looked at what I knew and thought-- what would I like to do?
