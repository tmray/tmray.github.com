title: Sleep Memory Loss

I know it happens to everyone. It must.

Have a great idea, but it's late. You're tired. 

But this idea will change the world. Change my life!

But it's late. I'm tired. Need to go to sleep.

I'm sure I'll remember tomorrow. How could an earth shattering revelation like this not be there when I wake up tomorrow?

Should write it down. Record it on my phone. 

No. Too tired. It'll be there tomorrow when I wake up. I'm sure of it. 

Nope.

Or, scenario number 2.

Before I fall asleep I should write that down. 

I do.

Next morning. Reading it back. 

What the hell was I thinking? That's just silly.

Oh wait! I just remembered what it was. 

Never mind.
