I mean really. Think back on that song for those that know. 

It goes along, catchy, poppy. Then it gets to the solo and for like 15 seconds the song is nonsense. And I've never heard anyone say they thought twice about it?

I'm gonna say what I think it is. Now keep in mind this is based on my own conspiracy theory derived from what I claim to remember from this period of time. 

I recall that **David Lee Roth** hated how **Eddie Van Halen** was leaning in a synth heavy rock direction. I want to even say I remember hearing Roth said you're the greatest guitar player in the world. No one wants to hear you play keyboard. 

So based on what I think, when they recorded the song Eddie said: fine you want a guitar solo? I'll give you a guitar solo!

Switched the time signature, picked up his guitar, banged on it for a few seconds and set it back down.

I mean seriously. listen to it. And we've just all accepted it because well, it was Eddie Van Halen.

That has always been my running theory. 

Now if you look, here is what wikipedia says about it.

> although the song does contain a guitar solo, which Eddie Van Halen claims is his favorite solo he never wrote. This refers to the fact that it was spliced together from multiple takes.

Multiple takes? Again, its like 15 seconds long. Compared to what I said it sounds even more passive aggressive.
