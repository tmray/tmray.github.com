title: how Martin Mull and Fred Willard changed my musical path
---
In my 20's I was really looking for something different. Nirvana had just broken out to the mainstream world which was a good thing. A good thing for a world that was kinda going through it's second disco area, but it was hair metal bands and commercial hip hop this time.

The problem was after that every band that was from the Nirvana scene got signed and promoted. Every existing band decided to make a grunge album to try and get a part of it. 

By this time I was done with it. There were few acts during this period I would even listen to in my own time. 

People I knew would play this stuff repeatedly. I still say to this day I don't ever need to here Pearl Jam's album 'Ten' ever again in my lifetime, it was played so much. 

I was singing for a metal band at the time that was on the verge of breaking up. Or at least getting rid of me it turned out. 

They were heading in the grunge direction and I wasn't feeling it anymore anyway. 

Problem was I didn't know where to look for something different. There wasn't really a streaming service at the time to suggest something. 

But I found a suggestion in the most unlikely place. A Nick-at-nite TV program. 

The show was called **Fernwood Tonight**. It was an obscure spinoff of another show from the 70's **"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman"**.
