[My band](http://lorenzosmusic.com) played a show recently. It wasn't a normal show, it was part of a city wide event called [#MakeMusicMadison](https://twitter.com/hashtag/makemusicmadison?s=09). An event where, for one day, musicians pop up to play in various public places. 

We were asked to play on a porch at someone's house right off the lake at 8pm. One of the last shows of the day. Seemed like a fun thing to do, no pressure.

As the day arrived and we started setting up on the porch, it started to feel intimidating? Why was this? I looked around and there were maybe thirty or forty people hanging around. Just talking, having a good time. 

So why was I suddenly so nervous? I've made a fool of myself in front of a much larger audience, with no problem. 

Was it because this intimate setting was so close that it was like I was talking to them directly as I performed? I guess if I think about it, it would have been far more devastating to see people walk away from us in this situation. 

Walking into it we had the attitude that if we were off that night it wasn't a huge deal. It was just for fun. But once we got there it seemed far more exposed. 

When we finished, that also proved how a setting like this is different. Everyone was very personal. Came right up to us and told us how they liked it. At a larger show I can walk right through the crowd and no one says a thing. 

I feel it was good to face a fear like that for such a pay off. Even though going into it we had no idea it would be such a terrifying thing.
