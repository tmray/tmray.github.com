I don't know what it is, but I wait and I wait for summer and feel like it's never going to come. And when it does it seems like a 3 day weekend that's almost over to me. 

Maybe it's because I've lived in the Midwest my whole life and dread winter as time goes on? July 4 was the first day that felt like summer and historically from days of school it was the beginning of the end. It meant vacation was close to ending. And what have I done by this milestone I always ask?

The strange thing is most times I am very much an "anything is possible" type of person. when weather is the subject I am not. 

Weather is a great mood for music. Making things sound like Halloween or gray cold air. And thinking back on times when things seemed that way may put imagery in ones head. Anticipating actual climate change is what I don't look forward to.
