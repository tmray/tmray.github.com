I love when realization happens. Something simple that takes a mundane task or thing you do over & over to a sense of disbelief. Because of something stupid you just didn't think to do. Your world changes. So many possibilities. All because you were shown something. 

This I love. 

Here is a current example. Podcasts, I have so many to listen to. I don't have time to hear all the ones I want to hear. Would need to stop listening to one to replace another just to fit it in. Told a friend this when he recommended a new one to me. Then he says-- "that's why I speed listen to mine". 

What the hell is that? Tells me it's like speed reading but with audio. Turn the player speed up to 2x and you can fit more in.

I never would have thought of that!

Sure it takes a few minutes to adjust to the way it sounds, but it changes everything. Not bogged down with overwhelming playlist anymore. 

This is the type of thing to remember. 

When you do something, share how its done. Even if it seems like it's obvious and you tell yourself, "everyone must already know this"? Because someone is always new at something somewhere and you may just open their eyes to a whole different opportunity.
