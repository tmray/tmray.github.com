title: The Simplest Ah-ha Moments Can Change Everything
---

I love when realization happens. Something simple that takes a mundane task or thing you do over & over to a sense of disbelief. Your world is changed. Because of something stupid you just didn't think to do. Your world changes. So many possibilities. All because you were shown something. 

This I love. 

A current example is this for me. I love podcasts but so many to listen to. I don't have time to hear all I want. would need to stop listening to one to replace another. Told a friend this when he recommended one to me. Then he says "that's why I speed listen to mine". What the hell is that? He tells me it's like speed reading but with audio. Turn the player speed up to 2x and you can fit more in.

I never would have thought of that!

sure it takes a few minutes to adjust to the way it sounds, but it changes everything. Not bogged down with overwhelming playlist anymore. 

This is the type of thing to remember. When you do something, share how its done. Even if it seems like it's obvious and you tell yourself, "everyone must already know this?" Because someone is always trying this same thing for the first time somewhere and you may just open their eyes to a whole new opportunity.
