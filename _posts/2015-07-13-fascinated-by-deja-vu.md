title: Fascinated By Deja Vu
---

I'm fascinated by deja vu. (see what I did there?) 

It happens to me a lot. And while reading about it this afternoon there are of course many different theories as to why it happens.

One theory says it's connected to epilepsy. But I don't know anybody that's said they've never experienced it in one way or another. So that can't be right can it?

> "The strongest pathological association of deja vu is with temporal lobe epilepsy. This correlation has led some researchers to speculate that the experience of deja vu is possibly a neurological anomaly related to improper electrical discharge in the brain."

I think the concept of studying something that you can’t clearly show other people is amazing. You can only describe what it is like to you. You don’t REALLY know what it is until you’ve experienced it. Like explaining being in love.

When it happens to me I find myself just trying to figure out what it was that it reminds me of. Like seeing an actor in a movie that you recognize, but just can't place.

And when you experience it, are you like me and think it's some big premonition? Something on another level is trying to tell you something? Why is that? Why does it always have to mean something?

I think it's just the spookiness of the “second site” that’s had. Tells you it must mean something. Why would such a unique experience be wasted on something that means nothing?
