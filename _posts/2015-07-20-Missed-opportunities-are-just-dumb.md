title: Missed opportunities are just dumb

I took a typing class when I was in high school. No. Let me rephrase that...

I enrolled in a typing class when I was in high school. I wanted the credits and I heard it was an easy course. And it was. Because I never went. 

I never even knew where the classroom was. 

It was before lunch so I always left early with friends. Thinking to myself, I'm never going to need to know how to type? Not knowing how engrained computers & technology would be later.

It did turn out to be an easy course. End of semester I got a C. For not even going? Always wondered how that was possible?

Now I know taking a simple interest in this class would have made my life easier later on. 

Dumb kid thinking he knew everything. 
Now adult, looking back at himself with fathers eyes pissed off that he gets it now. 

I try not to say no to anything I could learn just from this one memory. Always looking at it thinking-- I may be able to use or appropriate this knowledge down the line.
