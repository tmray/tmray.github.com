Growing up there was a commercial, take the nestea plunge. Was just a person standing at the edge of a pool, takes a drink and falls backwards into the water.

We had a pool and friends and I pretty much stood on the edge yelling "Nestea plunge!" and falling in pretty much all summer. 

Thought about that today. First time in a while.

Not because of summer or swimming. I've been thinking about doing something I wanted to try for a while. A new path.

Always seem to talk myself out of it or procrastinate. Then I go back to thinking about it. Study more about how to do it but never pull the trigger. 

Today I set myself up for situation where its on me to follow through. Whether I like it or not. Put myself out there. Made a commitment and said I could do it. 

Didn't do it for money. I did it so I could stop thinking to myself-- I should do that someday. 

Guess what? Its someday. And I convinced someone to take a chance on what I think I can do. 

Took the plunge. Nestea plunge. That's what made me think of it.
