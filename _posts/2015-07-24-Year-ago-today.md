title: Year ago today

That's the text or IM that I send people when their name shows up in my daily journal.

I had been using a site called ohlife.com for years that did a simple thing. It sent you and email at the end of the day with the subject line: 

_"How was your day today?"_

When you opened the email it would say, 

_"A year ago today you wrote this."_

Showing next what had been written and sent same day last year.

You respond to it and send it back. Simple.

It wasn't an app. It was just an email. Once I got over the fact it got R.E.M.'s "Losing my religion" in my head because of it's site name, I looked forward to it. 

Sometimes surprised me with things I didn't think were already a year old or things I forgot I was going to try.

My friends and family would even tell me "remember to put that in your thing!" They liked when I would send them update when their name showed up. 

The site closed down this year. I needed to find a way to carry on this ritual I enjoyed so much.

I tried a couple of different methods to recreate this. None that I liked really. 

Then I upgraded gmail to the new Inbox version. It has a snooze.

My method now. I send email to myself with my journal for today. Then I open it and snooze it for one year. When it comes back, I will respond again.
