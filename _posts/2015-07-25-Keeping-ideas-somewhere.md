title: Keeping ideas somewhere
---
Maybe because of the [new venture I'm entering](http://tmray.github.io/2015/07/21/Taking-the-plunge/) I'm thinking so much about keeping notes for thoughts & ideas.

I realize this is the 3rd post like it. Don't want it to seem like this is some, get things done blog. Just on my mind I guess. 

Writing down what you think somewhere is better than nothing. 

Thing is, a lot of ideas come to me when I ride my bike. I don't know if it's because all you can do is pedal so the mind wanders? The passing people? Scents in the air? But most things come to me during a bike ride. Lyrics. Ideas to try. Concepts for things I'm working on & so on.

I just posted about [having a pocket notebook](http://tmray.github.io/2015/07/23/Notebooks/). But if I stopped every time to write thoughts down, getting around would take forever. Used to think I could remember thought until I got to where I'm going. Never did.

My simple trick involves headphones with mic, Google mobile app & Google Keep.

When I think of something I click and hold headphone mic to activate Google search. After the tone I leave a message.

Just say "Note to self" to add it to Google Keep. That's it.

Later you can view your notes on computer or phone and do what you want with them.
