title: Weird memory of an angry puppet
---
It was a memory that just popped in my head for no real reason that I could think of. It was a stupid insignificant memory. In movies people have revelations, times they remember that inspire. I have songs that get stuck in my head and dumb shit like the following that plague my thoughts. 

I had a flash of a show from the mid-1990s enter my brain. It was a morning show that the newly launched FX network had. It stared TV's Tom Bergeron, who you may know from America's funniest videos. But it also starred a puppet, Bob.

This wasn't a kid show. It was a legit morning show like **Good Morning America** or **The Today Show**. They just had a puppet for some reason.

That's not even the weird part about the memory. I remembered an interview I saw on it. 

During the same time period there was show called [Mr. Rhodes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Rhodes). Wasn't a good show. It was a cross between **"Head of the class"** and **"Welcome back Kotter"** staring a comedian I had never heard of named [Tom Rhodes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Rhodes).

After all this, here was the thing that I just remembered. 

Tom Rhodes was on this morning show trying to promote his show, doing an interview. The job of the puppet during interviews was to add light hearted comments in a morning show fashion.

Well Tom Rhodes was not liking this set up. And I remember he would stop talking and just stare at the puppet when he said something. Looking at him annoyed. The puppet. He starred down a puppet.

The puppet, not having real eyes, didn't really get this I don't think. Then I remember, he finally started mocking the puppet. Poorly. And whoever was the puppet guy was on his game and started slinging the barbs back at him. Quicker, faster and funnier than Tom was. To the point where he gave up and walked off I believe. 

Now this is all just he way I remember it. I have not been able to find this interview online anywhere. 

No idea what made me think of that.
