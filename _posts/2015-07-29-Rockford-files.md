I've been watching the Rockford Files recently. It's a private detective television show starring James Garner from the 1970s.

There's one thing I noticed about shows from that time period. It may just be me, but I think that 40 year olds from 1970 look different from today's 40.

Reason I say that is, when I watch it Jim Rockford, at the time of filming, is my age. But when I look at him, he looks like someone my dad's age. But in reality he is my age. 

Maybe it has something to do with the way life spans have extended over the years. In the Middle Ages most people would only live into their forties. But now, you could live way beyond that. 

Or maybe it's just because now that I'm 40 it doesn't seem as old.

Is it healthy living? Or is it just extended living?

Personally I'd like to think I don't look like 1970s 40 year olds.
