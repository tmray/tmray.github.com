Did an interview with singer/songwriter **David Rovics** [on my podcast this weekend](http://www.musicmanumit.com/2015/08/david-rovics-returns-150802-music.html).

He had been on the show twice before and a man that likes to keep active. He always seems to be starting and/or getting ready to launch something every time we talk. Either tour, album or some new artistic project. One thing I know is I learn a new thing from him whenever we talk. 

This time, one of the things was just a simple solution to record audio on my phone. When he said it I just felt so dumb for not having realized it myself. I couldn't get over how much sense it made. 

To start, let me explain something. I have been looking for a good free app to record audio on my phone. I need it to automatically backup somewhere so I don't have to remember where it is later. I was using the SoundCloud app but I filled my free account to capacity.

I've tried a couple of other apps but none of them quite did what I want.

Talking with David I asked him about all the singles that he seems to release. Said he records the video on his phone for YouTube channel then uses mp4 file to upload audio to bandcamp. I couldn't believe how simple. 

I was just thinking of video on my phone as video. Single minded. Had not occurred to use it for audio on top of that. 

Videos are backed up to my Google drive, Dropbox, YouTube & Amazon cloud. And they are recorded as mp4 which can be used in most audio editing software as a sound file. 

I've said it before, it just takes one simple idea to open up a whole new world to someone that could use it.
