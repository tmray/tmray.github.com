title: Blogspot Chainsaw
---
I started out with blogger many years ago. It was actually how I learned html and CSS. Chipping away at the designs in the pre-built templates.

I still have a few of my sites there. Just don't want to migrate them. Plus it can handle heavy traffic and no server cost. 

The design templates, while very customizable, have not been updated in some time. I know how to build on top of one the way I want, I just wanted to start one fresh. 

After a lot of searching and trying different things I have a starting template to share. 

Chainsaw is a bare bones Google Blogspot template. It is meant to be a starting point for designing your own blogger theme. It takes a chainsaw to the blogger default template! Get it? (Sigh... I know.)

It comes with only a basic HTML page layout and the blogger code for the post editor and that's all.

From there you can either build out the html & blogger gadget code around this or just add gadgets from the layout section in blogger. Also write your own CSS in the template editor. None of the starting CSS is there to get in your way.

You can get it from my github repo [tmray/Chainsaw](https://github.com/tmray/chainsaw)
