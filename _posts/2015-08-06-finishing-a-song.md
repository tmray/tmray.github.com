title: Finishing a song
---
You would think it would bring satisfaction, triumph, feeling of achievement. It doesn't for me. It normally leaves me feeling disbelief. 

It's sudden when it happens. You question, is that really it? Like those V8 commercials where someone thunks your head and you stop confused trying to figure out what just happened. 

Spend so much time nurturing and dissecting it to try and make it perfect. Then you set up to do the same thing again one night. You run through it and... there's nothing left to do.

Last night we finished one that we had been working on for a month. And instead of a cheer, it's more like, I guess that's done? You look around to see if anyone has one last thing. No one does.

While that part always seems the let down, the reaction you were expecting comes later. When you look back on the song. When people download and tell you they like it. You listen again and then really feel that you created something.
