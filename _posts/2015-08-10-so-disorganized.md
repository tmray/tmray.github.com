title: So Disorganized
---
Feels like everything is just all over the place. I've been preparing for project I'm doing for weeks. Collecting data from market research, examples, swipe files, the whole bit.

Laid out exactly what we wanted to show could be accomplished. But when it comes time to do it I feel like everything I know, everything I've learned is lost. I'm doing what needs to be done and moving forward. It's just my head I think. 

I've been preparing, maybe over preparing, and to feel this way seems silly. 

Need to write down what happens and what was done to learn from later. Is that just creating more chaos? I hope not. 

What I hope is this feeling will breed familiarity. Like looking at a blank screen for first time to write a book. Self doubt & fear of failure are surely what everyone starts with the first time. A callus that needs to be built so you can power through this as time goes on I suspect. 

Need to stop blaming disorganization.
