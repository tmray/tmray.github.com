Years ago I decided to stop pirating software and move to open source tools. 

It was difficult at first but you adapt.

During this time it's gotten a lot more mature. Even a bit more well known as open source projects have become more popular. 

I started to seek out distributions that had more focus on these tools. One of them was **Ubuntu Studio**. 

Its a Linux operating system geared directly towards musicians, video makers & designers. 

I've been very happy with it and what it has installed right out of the box. 

**Ardour** for multi-track recording. **Inkscape** and **Gimp** for artwork. **Kdenlive** for video, among other things. 

They even have a live bootable DVD you can download to try it on your computer first without installing it. 

On the podcast that I do, Music Manumit, we were lucky enough this week to talk to Kaj, the person leading this project.

You can have a listen to the interview on the site. [Ubuntu Studio - 150816 - Music Manumit Podcast](http://www.musicmanumit.com/2015/08/ubuntu-studio-150816-music-manumit.html)
