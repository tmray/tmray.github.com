title: Weather, like Doctor Sax

Just when I felt like it was finally summer, the cold sets in. It's like someone flipped a switch that effected the Midwest. 

I've mentioned before my position on winter, questioning why I live here. But that's not what this is about.

One summer in my youth I read the book **On the road by Jack Kerouac**.

It was a 1970's reprint I found in a resale shop bin. Like most people, after reading it I wanted to get in a car and drive across the country. So me and a friend did just that. 

We took off in his pick up truck and headed to Portland Oregon to visit a friend. 

I shit you not, we made the trip in 24 hours. No stops, just drive. 

When we arrived, walked into my friends apartment, he handed me a beer. The next thing I remember is waking up the next morning kneeling on the floor face down with that same beer in my hand. Passed out instantly.

During our time there I stopped at a used bookstore and found a paperback copy of another **Jack Kerouac** book. **Doctor Sax**.

It was the tail end of summer. After about a week we headed back home.

At home the seasons were starting to cool. Autumn.

I started reading the book while riding in the moving truck I worked in. It's a very different book than on the road.

He describes a childhood in a small town and a mysterious entity that haunts him.

The description of this time was just so close to the way things were as I rode in this truck. It stuck. 

This weather always reminds me of this book. And instead of my hate for the cold. This change has a tendency to inspire. It's like a time portal that takes me back to that moment.
