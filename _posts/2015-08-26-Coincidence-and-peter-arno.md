Yesterday I wrote about [the time a friend and I found the book **Doctor Sax** at a used bookstore](/2015/08/25/weather-like-doctor-sax/).

Today I got a text from that friend asking to meet up at lunch. He had moved back here around 2005 from Portland.

When I met him he handed me something. Told me he saw this somewhere yesterday and knew that I'd like it.

It was an old hard cover book of collected [**Peter Arno**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Arno) cartoons.

How strange? The day I thought of that story.

This artists style is right in line with what I like. Much like [**Dean Haspiel**](https://twitter.com/deanhaspiel) who I've mentioned before. Also similar to [**Andi Watson**](https://instagram.com/andicomics/), another great artist.

The simplistic yet styled cartoon people in them are what do it for me. They can be comfortable in a serious setting yet be completely at home in something that is just absurd.

And the rough texture of the outlines and inking is what really makes it my favorite over all. Big thick course pencil-like lines.

A really great thing to get a copy of.
