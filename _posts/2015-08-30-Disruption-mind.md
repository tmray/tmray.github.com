title: Disruption Mind
---
That's what I like to call it.

The past couple of weeks things have been different. My normal schedule has been off it's course. It will only be that way for a few more days but I'm starting to feel it. 

I only have a few things that I really like to accomplish in a day, and I am. I've just had to do it differently because of this.

Things like this happen from time to time in many ways and they can consume my head. It doesn't feel right. Like something is stuck in there.

The same way it feels when you try to start a car when the battery is dead. You stop and think to yourself-- it's gonna work this time, and try it again.

That's the thing I've dubbed disruption mind here.

It can bleed over into other things and just make you question it all.

Editing,I felt it while editing my podcast.

Musically, working on writing a new song last night. Nothing seemed right. Something was missing.

Client work, no longer seemed to be delivering right. Seemed fine then it wasn't. Started second guessing what I had created and researched.

Usually I can see things pretty optimistically. Even try to take it as an oppertunity to learn something, most cases.

But when head gets stopped up like this with disruption. Like that car, seems stuck.

I know it won't last long. Never does. Something changes it and ideas start flowing again.

Sense of relief, like when you finally get that car battery jumped and it starts? We all know what that's like. Everything seems normal again.
