title: you never expect a magician
---
Truth be told I've actually thought about this situation before. I've asked friends about it. What would it be like to know a magician?

Today I got a glimpse of that answer. 

It wasn't the magician I was expecting though. I expected a **David Copperfield** or a **David Blaine** type. One that takes it maybe too seriously. 

I pictured it more this way. Even when doing something simple like-- passing the salt, their hands get all swoopy and dramatic as they hand it over.

What I got today was more of a **Doug Henning**. He was more the hippy magician. Or as he would say illusionist. 

It was still quite the experience.

I was at a store returning something and greeted by a man with his hair in a ponytail on top of his head and a braided beard. He was very nice and helpful. The term "no worries, no worries" was used like the period at the end of each sentence.

As I walked with him to another area in the store I noticed a wooden stick in his back pocket. Thought it was a drumstick. He kept swinging it around during conversation.

That's when he worked into the conversation, "Do you like magic?"

I of course had to ask him to repeat himself because who expects that to be asked? Needed to make sure I heard it right.

He of course responded with "no worries, no worries."

Then started to pitch to me his magic act and told me when he performs most weeks. It started to dawn on me, the stick in his pocket was a wand! 

But I have to say he did try make a connection with me while I was at the store. He helped me, we did what I needed to do. Then after getting to know me in those few minutes, told me what he does and asked me to check it out if I like.

While it was weird, I wasn't annoyed that he did it. It was personable. And now I know where to see him.

I mean, I'm not gonna go. But I respect the way he tried.
