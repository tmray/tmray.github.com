I remember the actor that played all of the adult male characters on the show **You can't do that on television**.

There was the messy drunk, a gross cook, a conniving boss or a dictator to name a few.

Whatever happened to him? I know he passed away a few years back. I mean career-wise.

He was like the first character actor I was ever aware of. Most people that remember the show, didn't even know it was the same guy playing all those parts.

He was like my 80's pop culture **De Niro**. I would have liked to see him in some dark comedy film.
