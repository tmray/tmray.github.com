title: Always something to learn

Just when I think I have it figured out, something else comes into play. I don't mean this negatively. 

While working on a project, in an area that I've been studying and researching. I was doing everything the way I knew how. How I had planned.

When a tiny detail, within it, right where I was already looking, suddenly came into site. Like when you stare at one of those computerized art posters from the 90s that just look like red and white dots, until you figure out the trick to seeing it. Then there's a 3D image of a plane, or a tree or something.

It was like that.

I just wasn't looking at it right. Took one little thing, something I heard on a podcast. Made me think, wait, why don't I try that idea this?

Now I have a whole new view.

I knew [previous frustration](/2015/08/30/Disruption-mind) would end well.
