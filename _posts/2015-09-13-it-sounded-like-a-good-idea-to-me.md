title: It sounded like a good idea to me
---
Talked with musician Chris Zabriskie [on my podcast this week](https://www.musicmanumit.com/2015/09/another-chris-zabriskie-150913-music.html).

He's put out several albums and his songs have been used in many different places. From **Cartoon Network** to **Nissan** and even used in a **porn movie**. All while distributed under a **creative commons license**.

We've had him on the show several times and he's a great guy to talk to and learn things from.

This time we had him on to talk about his new album [Thoughtless](https://amzn.to/1NqSMhs).

During the conversation he told me an idea he was thinking of when he made the album. He wanted to transfer it to a vhs tape. Plug directly into a VCR and record the audio to it, using a stack of vhs tapes that he had.

I thought that sounded cool. I had this thought in my head as to how it would sound. Digital imperfections that would make it sound unique. Sounds that couldn't be achieved through natural ways or effects. I got really excited that it!

I texted my guitarist who also runs a studio, asking him if he had ever tried that? Wondering what he thought about it?

He just texted me back, _"Ha! Yes I have. Why?"_

I explained what I was thinking and the conversation I had with Chris about it. 

He just asked why would you want to do something like that? Said its more of a hassle and I would probably be disappointed with the result.

Maybe I would. But, Mark works on audio with people everyday. What I was asking him is the kind of sound he tries to prevent.

I guess I just like the way the concept sounded. 

You get to tell people that you did something like that, transfered it to vhs. While maybe not a good idea, it makes a great story.

It worked on me. When I heard about this all I could think was, this guy really thinks outside the box!

I still want to try it. I think the way you do things can get people motivated about what it is.
