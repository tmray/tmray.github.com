title: Toothbrushing dream
---
Had a dream last night I was just brushing my teeth while I was doing whatever else was going on in it. Like really just trying to clean the molars in the back of my mouth.

I want to say I was so invested in it that the characters that were showing up in the dream spent most of their time trying to get my attention. As if they were feeling neglected. like, _"Hey! I'm trying to put on a show here!?"_

But I just kept slowly moving the toothbrush from the top of my gums down the tooth in the back of my mouth.

I mention that to someone today and they looked it up. Supposedly it means I feel underappreciated, feeling I need to move on from what I've been doing. 

I wouldn't say I need to move on from what I do, maybe just how I do it. I've pulled the trigger on some plans. Picking up client work and expanding what I do creatively with music. But I do want more.

On the other hand it was just a dream. Why do we take so much stock in what we see there?

Although it wasn't really off the mark.
