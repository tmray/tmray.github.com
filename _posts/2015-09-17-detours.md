I like to get in my car and take little mini vacations. They used to be much longer vacations but now they're just mini ones because of work and marriage.


The concept is: I would get in my car, pick a direction, and drive. I would just continue to go, not knowing where I was. 


Sometimes these little adventures would actually take me as far as another state. One time it even consisted of staying in a new town for an entire week. Meeting people.


Can't really do that anymore. But I still, when the mood hits me, get in my car and just go.


I think it's been awhile since I did that. 


The feeling struck me today. Maybe it was a mixture of how quickly and grey the sky became with clouds, mixed with summer foliage turning into colorful fall.


I was on my lunch break and just drove straight, not really caring.


The best part about these adventures is that even though you're not far from home everything still looks new. 


Today I found myself in a small town to cities over. One that I've never been to, even though I've lived here my whole life.


The main drawback about all this is that it's way too easy to find your way back, what with GPS maps on our phones these days and all. What seemed like driving forever, turns out to only be a short distance from where I was originally going. The country roads just went the long way around.
