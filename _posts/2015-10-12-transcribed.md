For days now I've been doing transcriptions. Pouring over huge audio recordings of band practices. 

I'm doing this because, I got this idea to document and piece them together as audio scenes in a series format.

At first I thought I could wing it. On the fly. Put it together in my head and arrange the pieces. 

The more I listened, the more I forgot...Where things were said, on what take, at what time in the recording. It became overwhelming. 

So I realized I was just making it harder by not doing it. Writing time signature and quotes. Key elements & sound reference. 

Surprisingly it only took a day or so, in my free time. Still much but not unreasonable. 

What I found from doing this is, with a greater understanding of what I had recorded, I found a different perspective. A different angle to tell the story I set out to do.

I think knowing what had happened after the fact, shined a light on what I missed. Even though I was there.
