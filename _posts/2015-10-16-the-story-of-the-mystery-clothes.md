I was out at the studio with my friend Rob. It was a cold October night. And at one point I went outside to have a cigarette.

The door to our recording studio is at the end of a long alleyway between two buildings that leads out to a sidewalk. And there's not really any lighting there.

As I walked I thought I saw something lying there. Of course at first, me being paranoid, I thought it was a dead animal or something. But it wasn't.

What was laying there was a pile of clothes. Now I'm not talking a laundry basket of clothes, what was there was specifically, a pair of grey sweatpants and one of those hippie wool hooded pullovers.

First after staring at the clothes, I looked down the street one way and then turned and looked down the street the other way. Nobody was around.

Just to make sure that I wasn't going crazy and seeing things I went inside and got Rob. Had him come with me to witness the pile of clothes that I saw. They were still there. They were real.

He did the same thing as me and look down the street one way and look down the other. And again we didn't see anybody. 

We both agreed it was very strange. And we were both confused and concerned at the same time. What the hell are these clothes doing here?

Anyway there was nothing more we could do so we went inside.

At the end of the night we had kind of forgotten all about it. As we left and walked out into the street, both Rob and I stopped at the same time and turned around. The clothes that were in the pile there before were gone!?

What in the living hell is going on? No one would come by and be like, "Hey, a pile of street clothes! Sweet!" and take them?

I just thought the whole thing was very strange.
