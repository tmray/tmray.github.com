title: Talked with State Shirt
---
I got the chance to talk with **Ethan Tufts** this weekend [on my podcast.](http://www.musicmanumit.com/2015/10/state-shirt-2-151025-music-manumit.html)

Ethan, is a musician that goes by the name **State Shirt**. Had him on the show before and this time he was back to talk about his [**new album "Lost Hills"**](http://music.stateshirt.com/album/lost-hills).

This isn't out of the ordinary to have a guest on promoting a new album. In fact, it's usually one of the main reasons we have someone on the show. 

But being a podcast focusing primarily on **creative commons musicians**, we don't normally talk to people that promote themselves as other bands do.

That's not to say bands we talk to don't promote their music. But a lot of creative commons musicians don't necessarily do it for fame. They just do it-- to do it. 

It's one of the things I love about the culture.

But people do contact me with questions, asking for ways they could get their music out there and still maintain status in the creative commons realm.

So when we get a guest that has, hit the pavement. Sent out his stuff. Knocked on some doors, things like that. I take the opportunity to get more of that process out of them.

I got so wrapped up in this, I didn't even get a chance to talk to him about his “Seedie Release” concept. If you order his physical CD it comes with seeds you can plant. 

Get it? “Seedie”? 

I love meeting people that find different and unique ways of doing this. It's one of the best reasons for doing the show.
