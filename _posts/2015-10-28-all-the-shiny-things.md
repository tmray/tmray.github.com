I have a problem I need to fix. 

While I control and manage most of my creative projects personally, I can always picture the end result I want in my head. 

This is good for what I want to do--But bad for trying to get it done. 

As I start to work on say, a website, imagery or anything visual, if it doesn't look like it should right away, I will get sidetracked trying to fix it first before moving on.

Case in point, I am redesigning my bands website to match the theme with an upcoming song release. And I have been obsessing over the featured content box on the homepage.

I know I have the entire rest of the website to finish but I can't look at it with out thinking it appears terrible to me. 

I finally had to make myself stop. Move to the next section. 

Gave myself one more day to work on it. If the rest of the site didn't make it tie together, then I would scrap it and start over.

I have more things to cover than just a feature widget. This fussing before I finish just becomes a delay. 

I wonder if I need to start thinking about utilizing fivver more? Outsourcing things so I can learn to let them go. 

Why do things seem to never look like you think they should as you build?
