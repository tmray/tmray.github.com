title: Like a switch...

Outside of the fact that every year Christmas decorations appear in stores earlier than the year before. Why does Halloween end so abruptly? Turned off like a light switch.

It is the morning after Halloween and my email inbox is already filled with holiday promotions. As I am writing this, I just got an invite to my friends annual Christmas party.

I'm just curious why it doesn't get the same time consideration as Christmas? I'm just supposed to move right on to the next. 

But when Christmas is over, its perfectly OK to keep your decorations up well into February.

I think I'm just upset that I know winter comes next.
