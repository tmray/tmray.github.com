## Trying to break free of a cms

So I was thinking about building Jekyll sites since hosting is soo easy with github pages. But how would an author use it?

Then I discovered [prose.io](http://prose.io "link")

So I'm testing out this post to see if it may bridge the gap for non-developers, who just want a website without having to maintain a CMS. So that's what this post is. A test.

I already use the [MrHyde mobile app](http://faudroids.org/MrHyde/ "link") to do this on android. I just needed one for the browser.

It even looks like it has a front-matter option in the menu to use. Although it's called a meta-data editor which was not obvious at first. But it works!

Cool find.
