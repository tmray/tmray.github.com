title: Back to the drawing board... Literally.
---
Been trying to find a way for a while now to combine things I like to do -- drawing, music, podcasting, promotion & web. 

Thing is I kept thinking of them separately. Which, I still do. 

But I had an idea as I was putting together a video tutorial for a promotional project. I was editing the video to make it not seem so involved. 

So I started storyboarding what I had done so far on paper. Then as I looked at the drawings I thought why can't I just clean those up and use them? 

I tell you why. It would take too long. 

So here is my goal. I am going to try and keep most of my artwork mobile. Think of a way to do what I need only using my phone. I think that way I won't be tempted to make it more involved. Plus, I'll be able to work on it anywhere. 

I can then use those drawings as slides in a PowerPoint. Record the audio separately, and play it along with the slides, recording it to video. Like a storyboard animatic. 

It's just a way I think I can work on building my other skills while sticking with my current project. And maybe, mixing all the things I want to do together.
