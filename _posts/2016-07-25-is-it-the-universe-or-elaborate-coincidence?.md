title: Is it the universe or elaborate coincidence?
---
Ok so I have been a person that, in the past, has said "I think everything happens for a reason".

When I say that, it was usually because something bad happened and I believe whatever it is you get through it and learn from it. 

I've never meant it in the trivial way it's sometimes used like -- if it's raining on the day you decide to take up jogging, you think the universe is trying to tell you something. 

That being said, I do think that there is an elaborate orchestration to life. We exist and have complex circulatory systems. How? That's crazy right!? 

So, why can't I think ghosts and parallel forces are helping us do things? Even small things. Because you never know what significance it can have later on. 

An example, (all be it a stupid one); several years ago I took a trip to Texas. While we were there I was looking for a comic book store. Instead the cab driver took me to an independent book shop. I guess he thought it was a comic shop. 

Anyway, he had already left so I figured I'd go inside and check it out. It was a cool place but no comics. 

Then on one shelf I saw what looked like a graphic novel that was filled with several indie comic publishers stories. It was saran wrapped with a few small indie "zine" books as well. 

I figured what the hell, I can read it on the plane ride home. So I got it, put it in my bag and forgot all about it. Never even opened it. 

Fast forward to today, I've been thinking about pursuing comic book art again. I was researching ways to learn more about visual storytelling in the page panels and layout.

One artist I looked up recommends this book "Cartooning - Philosophy and Practice" by **Ivan Brunetti**. Says it's a whole class course in a small paperback book.

I look at the cover and I feel like I've seen it before?

You guessed it. It was one of the things I thought was a zine wrapped with that book I bought years ago. 

I dug out the package it came in from my closet and opened it. Turns out the book is really inspired and insightful. I don't think I would have purchased it otherwise. 

So why did I? What made me think to get it that day? Was there fate involved? Did some force really make me go to that shop, knowing I would need that book later in my life?

I can't explain why things happen but they have to start somewhere.
