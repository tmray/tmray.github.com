title: How Bandcamp’s Donation ALMOST Got It Right
---
Here’s a scenario to show you where I’m coming from.

Let's say you own a little store. You don't make much money but you enjoy it.

Then one day a group of people come into your store and tell you “From now on, you need to pay us a percentage of your earnings if you want to keep your store.”

So what do you do? In this case, you pay them so you can keep your store.

Now let’s say those same people come in to collect their money as usual, only this time they add - “Hey, next week we’re going to donate the money we take from you to charity. Tell all your friends to buy more stuff to add to the cause.”

Now, if this happened would you say - _Oh my! Those people that take my money are so generous, Hat’s off to them!_

I’m not sure I would react in that manner. This is where I get confused with the praise I’m seeing for **Bandcamp** today.  

While the fact that they are donating to the ACLU is a great thing. **They aren’t actually doing it.**

If you look at the blog post they wrote it says this:

> artists and labels have joined us in donating their Bandcamp profits today to the ACLU... **Bandcamp will be donating 100% of our share of the proceeds to the ACLU**

_Source - [daily.bandcamp.com](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2017/02/02/nobannowall-over-150-labels-artists-join-us-in-donating-fridays-profits-to-the-aclu/#more-34525)_

Unless I’m reading that wrong, **they aren’t really donating, the artists are**. They are just donating what they already take.

I’m not saying they shouldn’t do this, I think it’s great that they are. I just feel it would be more meaningful **if they matched donations people made**, even if just up to a certain amount.

The people that should be commended in the many posts and retweets and shares I’m seeing today are the artists participating in my opinion, not Bandcamp.
