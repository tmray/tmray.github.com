My skin and my feet become uncomfortable in doctors offices.

Ive been leaning on drawing lately to help take my mind off of things. I'm currently reading a lesson book called ["Cartooning philosophy and practice" by **Ivan Brunetti**](http://amzn.to/2qjhjBH). 

I hopped on Twitter the other day and streamed video of me going through lesson 4

The outcome is an 8 panel comic of a character made of shapes, a location, an object and an action.

Here is mine when I was finished.
