I am the singer/songwriter for the band [Lorenzo's Music](https://www.lorenzosmusic.com).<br/>
I'm also run the show [Tom Ray's Art Podcast](https://www.tomrayswebsite.com).

**Lorenzo's Music** is described as the band Spoon if it were produced by Tom Waits.
All of the music is under creative commons and available for commercial use.

**Tom Ray's Art Podcast** is an interview show I started to meet artists and creators from professional to beginners and talk about what they do.

This blog is just a place to post my thoughts.<br/>
These may involve, but are not limited to:<br/>
things I'm working on, artistic ventures, experiences, or the virtually out of nowhere pop-culture references that get stuck in my head.
