I am the singer/songwriter for the band [Lorenzo's Music](http://www.lorenzosmusic.com).<br/>
Also the co-host of the [Music Manumit Podcast](http://www.musicmanumit.com).

**Lorenzo's Music** is described as the band Spoon if it were produced by Tom Waits.
All of the music is under creative commons and available for commercial use.

**Music Manumit** is an interview show I started with [@dawmusicmanumit](https://twitter.com/dawmusicmanumit), we talk to musicians that release music under **creative commons**.

This blog is just a place to post my day to day thoughts.<br/>
These may involve, but are not limited to:<br/>
things I'm working on, artistic ventures, experiences, or the virtually out of nowhere pop-culture references that get stuck in my head.
